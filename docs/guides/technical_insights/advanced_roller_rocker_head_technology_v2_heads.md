# Advanced Roller Rocker Head Technology (V2 Heads)

The fundamental principle of the roller rocker design is its capacity to accommodate significantly more aggressive ramp profiles on the camshaft. This innovation enables the valves to open more swiftly, remain open for an extended duration, and close more rapidly, thereby enhancing the engine's fuel intake. Additionally, the roller tip reduces the coefficient of friction, which minimizes parasitic losses due to friction and heat. Consequently, the camshaft operates with diminished drag and heat accumulation. Collectively, these advancements culminate in a remarkably powerful system, offering significant and substantial performance gains over stock configurations.
