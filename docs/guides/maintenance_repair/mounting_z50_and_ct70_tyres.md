# Tire Assembly Guide

1. **Preheat the Tire**  
   Position the tire in front of a heater for a period of time to soften it.

2. **Inflate the Tube**  
   Inflate the tube sufficiently to form a round shape, ensuring it does not become pinched between the rim halves.

3. **Assemble the Rim Halves**  
   Utilize four 40mm long, 8mm flange bolts to draw the two rim halves together. Alternate the tightening process to gradually secure the rims.

4. **Lubricate the Bead Area**  
   Apply a lubricant, such as Simple Green, to the bead area.

5. **Secure the Rim Halves**  
   Place a piece of 4x4 wood on end with the rim halves positioned on either side of the tire. Press the top rim half onto the bottom rim half while an assistant threads the nuts onto the 40mm bolts, bringing the rim halves together. Once aligned, insert three 20mm bolts into the hub-mounting holes to maintain the center alignment of the rim halves. Subsequently, replace each of the four 40mm bolts with the appropriate length rim bolts around the wheel's outer edge.

6. **Seat the Bead**  
   Once the four shorter bolts are securely fastened, inflate the tire to 25-30 PSI to seat the bead on the rim.

7. **Final Adjustments**  
   Allow the assembly to rest overnight. Adjust the tire's air pressure the following day, remove the three bolts from the hub-mounting holes, and attach the completed wheel to the hub.
