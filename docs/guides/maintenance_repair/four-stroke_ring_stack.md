# Piston Ring Installation Guide

## Top to Bottom Assembly

1. **Compression Ring**: The topmost ring, often with a shiny appearance, is the compression ring. It typically features a dot or letter stamped on it, which should face upwards.

2. **Oil Scraper Ring**: The middle ring, characterized by its thick black color, is the oil scraper. It also has a dot or letter stamped on it, which should face upwards.

3. **Oil Rings**: This consists of three componentsâ€”two thin rings and one ridged (wavy) ring.

## Bottom to Top Assembly

1. **Expander Ring**: Place the wavy expander ring in the lower groove.

2. **Lower Oil Ring**: Position the lower oil ring beneath the expander ring in the lower groove.

3. **Upper Oil Ring**: Install the upper oil ring above the expander ring in the lower groove.

4. **Middle Ring**: Insert the black ring into the center groove.

5. **Top Ring**: Place the silver ring in the top groove, ensuring the markings on the ring face upwards.

## End Gaps

- Set the top ring gap 180 degrees from the wrist pin, then space the gaps evenly at one-third intervals.
- Ensure the end gaps of the piston rings are not aligned with each other to prevent smoking; they should be evenly spaced apart.
