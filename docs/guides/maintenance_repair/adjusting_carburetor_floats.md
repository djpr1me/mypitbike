# Adjusting Carburetor Floats


**How to Adjust Your Motorcycle Carburetor Float Level**

This guide, accompanied by illustrative images, aims to dispel any confusion surrounding the adjustment of your carburetor's float level. Achieving the correct float level is paramount, as it influences all jetting circuits. **SETTING THE FLOAT LEVEL IS THE INITIAL STEP TOWARDS OPTIMIZING YOUR JETTING**.

To elucidate the internal workings of your float bowl, let's first delve into the underlying theory. Contrary to common misconceptions, the engine's intake vacuum alone lacks the strength to draw in the necessary fuel for optimal operation, let alone any operation. Engines necessitate a form of pressure to propel fuel into the intake tract, where it can amalgamate with a metered volume of air before combustion. This pressure is generated through the use of a venturi and the principles outlined by the Bernoulli Effect. The venturi accelerates the airflow of the incoming charge, which concurrently reduces the pressure within the venturi. The pressure differential between the venturi and the float bowl naturally seeks equilibrium, and it is this differential that generates the 'fuel pressure' essential for proper engine function.

The fuel system on most off-road and motocross motorcycles employs a carburetor of the gravity feed type. As the name implies, it relies on gravitational forces to draw fuel from the gas tank down to the carburetor and into the float bowl. Given that your float bowl is vented, atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi) continuously acts upon the predetermined volume, or weight, of fuel within the float bowl. As air traverses the carburetor bore (venturi), a pressure drop occurs, and the fuel in the float bowl becomes 'pressurized' as the pressure between the float bowl and the carburetor bore (venturi) seeks to equalize. By modifying the volume or weight of fuel in the float bowl, you effectively alter the fuel pressure exerted on your jets. An increased fuel level in the float bowl will enhance fuel pressure, resulting in richer running conditions for a specified set of jets.
