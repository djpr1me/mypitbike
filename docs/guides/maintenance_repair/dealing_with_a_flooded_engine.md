# Dealing with a Flooded Engine

## Steps to Address a Flooded Engine

1. **Remove the Spark Plug**  
   If your engine is flooded, begin by removing the spark plug.

2. **Clear Excess Fuel**  
   With the spark plug removed, kick the engine over approximately ten times to expel any excess fuel.

3. **Install a New Spark Plug**  
   Once the excess fuel has been cleared, insert a new spark plug.

## Additional Tip

Occasionally, it may be beneficial to slightly open the throttle to allow a small amount of air to enter. This should be done with great care, ensuring only a minimal adjustment.
