## Procedure

With the clutch basket securely positioned:

1. Position the thicker slotted washer onto the main shaft and rotate it 1/8 of a turn to reveal the slots in the shaft.
2. Place the thinner pronged washer with the points facing downward or towards the engine.
3. Align the hub with the threaded towers facing downward and centered.

## Clutch Information

Ensure that all surfaces of the drive and driven plates are thoroughly oiled during installation.
