# Pit Bike Setup Guide

## Pre-Ride Preparation and Inspection

These procedures are recommended for all motorcycles and pit bikes.

1. **Immediate Oil Change:** Prior to starting the engine, replace the oil with 10w40 non-synthetic oil. The oil initially present in the engine is solely for accidental engine turnover and is of inferior quality, unsuitable for operation. Maximum oil capacity is 900ml.
2. **Engine Break-In:** Operate at low speeds with minimal loads for the initial 2-4 hours. It is permissible to increase the engine's revolutions, but avoid imposing significant loads, such as ascending steep inclines.
3. **Fastener Inspection:** Ensure all fasteners are secure. Loctite, a liquid adhesive available at most automotive stores, should be used. Apply **Blue Loctite** to nuts and bolts. Note that damage or loss due to unsecured bolts is not covered under warranty.
4. **Chassis and Structural Fastening:** Utilize **Red Loctite** for chassis, shock, subframe, and rear sprocket bolts.

## Additional Useful Information

- Inspect all electrical connections, securing and cleaning as necessary. Apply non-conductive grease.
- Verify the proper operation of all controls.
- Lubricate throttle and clutch cables using WD-40, avoiding grease.
- Secure handlebar grips with glue and/or wire ties.
- Adjust shock and fork settings for compression and dampening.
- Install an inline fuel filter.
- Grease the steering head bearing and ensure it is tightened.
- Apply anti-seize lubricant to the swing arm pivot bolt.
- Lubricate front and rear axles with anti-seize, avoiding the threads.
- Check valve lash settings (.003 intake and .004 exhaust).
- Verify tire pressure.
- Ensure chain slack is between 1 inch and 1.5 inches at the midpoint of the swingarm.
- Level the carburetor from side to side.
- If fuel overflows, adjust the float level, as stock float levels may sometimes be misaligned.
- Install rim locks if feasible, at least on the rear rim.
- Inspect the gas tank for debris, dust, or flash, and remove any found.
- **Note for YX 150/160 Models:** Check the tightness of the clutch nut and oil slinger nut, and adjust valves before startup.

Failure to adhere to these instructions may result in damage to your motorcycle, which will not be covered under warranty. For instance, if the chain slack is not properly checked and it detaches, causing damage, the affected part will not be covered under warranty if the chain was not correctly adjusted.
