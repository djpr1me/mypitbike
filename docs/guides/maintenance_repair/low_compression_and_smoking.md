# Addressing Smoke Issues and Low Compression

Motorcycle engines, including those of pit bikes, may occasionally emit a small amount of smoke. However, when a persistent and substantial volume of smoke is observed, it is imperative to investigate and resolve the underlying problem.

## Guidelines for Engine Maintenance

1. **Breaking in New Engines**  
   It is essential to break in new pit bikes and engines using petroleum-based oil (non-synthetic).

2. **Common Causes of Smoke in Used or Worn Engines**  
   Engines that exhibit smoke may be experiencing the following issues:
   - **Worn or Damaged Piston Rings**  
     The piston rings may be worn out or broken, leading to smoke emission.
   - **Degraded Piston**  
     The piston, a component subject to wear, should be replaced with every alternate ring change.
   - **Deteriorated Valve Seals**  
     Worn valve seals can contribute to smoke production.

3. **Valve Sealing Surface Concerns**  
   - **Carbon Build-Up on Valves**  
     Excessive carbon accumulation on the valves may result in leakage.

4. **Torque Specifications for CRF50 Type Engines**  
   Ensure that the top head nuts are torqued to a minimum of 110 in-lbs on CRF50 type engines.
