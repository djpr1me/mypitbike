# Ensuring Proper Piston Ring End Gap

Ensuring the correct piston ring end gap is crucial to prevent potential engine damage. Although new rings are typically within specifications, it is prudent to verify their measurements.

## Procedure for Checking Ring End Gap

1. **Insert the Ring into the Cylinder**: Carefully place the ring inside the cylinder.
2. **Align the Ring**: Use the piston to square the ring within the bore.
3. **Measure the End Gap**: Employ a feeler gauge to ascertain the end gap.

### General Guideline

- The basic rule of thumb is to allow 0.004 inches of clearance per inch of bore diameter.

### Specifications
