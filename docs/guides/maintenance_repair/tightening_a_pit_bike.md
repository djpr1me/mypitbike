# Tightening a pit bike

1. Check the brake fluid levels in both the front and rear brake reservoirs, as well as the engine oil level (the required volume is approximately 900 ml).
2. If necessary, replace the fluids. DOT4 is the preferred choice for brake fluid.
3. Verify the torque of all bolts to ensure everything is in its proper place and securely fastened.
4. Bolts securing the rear brake caliper, swingarm pivot nut, brake pedal bolt

10. The air filter should be clean and soaked with special oil.
11. We highly recommend applying threadlocker (Loctite) to all bolts, with particular attention to the list provided above.
