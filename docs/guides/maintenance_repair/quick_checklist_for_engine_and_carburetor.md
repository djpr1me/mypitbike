# Quick Checklist for Engine and Carburetor

## Installation of Intake Manifold

1. Attach the intake manifold to the head and carburetor. Apply oil to the gaskets and initially tighten the bolts lightly. Gradually torque them down in a crisscross pattern to ensure a proper seal and prevent air leaks.

## Throttle Cable Adjustment

1. Verify the throttle cable adjustment:
   - The carburetor slide must reach the bottom.
   - Test it by listening for the sound of the slide hitting the bottom of the carburetor.
   - Ensure there is free play or slack in the throttle cable.

## Ensuring Proper Seals and Connections

1. Confirm a secure seal between the intake and the head, as well as between the intake and the carburetor, to prevent any intake leaks.
2. Ensure all electrical connections are secure, and establish a reliable ground from the engine to the frame. Verify the presence of a spark.

## Fuel and Jetting

1. Check for adequate fuel flow and ensure the fuel is fresh.
2. Refer to our jetting guide and perform a plug reading. Consult our simple guide to jetting techniques.

## Head Studs Tightening

1. Ensure the head studs are properly tightened:
   - Torque to 110 inch-pounds for all Round Cam cover motors.
   - Torque to 16 foot-pounds for all KLX Head Motors.

## Addressing a Flooded Engine

1. In the event of a flooded engine, remove the spark plug and kick the engine over approximately ten times with the plug removed.
2. Install a new spark plug.

## Additional Tip

- Occasionally, it may be beneficial to slightly open the throttle to allow a small amount of air in.
