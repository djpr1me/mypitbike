# Testing Electrical Systems & Components

## Initial Steps

1. Obtain a new spark plug and test for spark.

2. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and establish a reliable ground from the engine to the frame.

3. Disconnect the kill switch, as the system will operate and produce a spark without it.

## Coil Components

The coil assembly consists of three parts:
- Coil
- Wire
- Cap

Ensure you have a suitable spark plug. Pit bikes utilize the same plug as the CRF50 and KLX110 models.

## Testing Separate Electrical Components

### Stator

1. After removing the ignition cover, perform a visual inspection of the coil bar. Look for any bulges or discoloration, which may indicate wear.

2. Set the voltage meter to AC to test the output. The stator should produce 80-100VAC, typically on the black/red wire.

3. Adjust the meter to measure OHMs. An open circuit or infinite OHMs indicates a malfunction.

### Coil

1. Set the meter to measure OHMs. An open circuit or infinite OHMs signifies a defect.
