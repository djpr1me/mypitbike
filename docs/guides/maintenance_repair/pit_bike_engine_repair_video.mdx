# Pit bike engine repair (video)

On the vast expanse of YouTube, we discovered a video guide on repairs. The author occasionally confuses terms like bolts and screws, yet we must express our gratitude for the detailed filming of the pit bike engine disassembly process. We already had written articles with illustrations on how to correctly disassemble and assemble a pit bike engine, and now there is a video available, and in Russian no less.
