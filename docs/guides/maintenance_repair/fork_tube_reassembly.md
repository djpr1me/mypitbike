# Fork tube reassembly

Video series in three parts on disassembling and changing the oil in fork tubes, using Fastace Forks as an example. A common fork often found on BSE pit bikes.

#### Some Recommendations

**Oil Volumes** Right fork (with red tip) - 150 ml Left fork (with blue tip) - 125 ml **Air Pressure** *For a rider weighing ~95 kg:* Right fork (with red tip) - 70-80 psi / 5.2 bar Left fork (with blue tip) - 150 psi / 10.3 bar *For a rider weighing ~65 kg:* Right fork (with red tip) - 40-45 psi / 3.1 bar Left fork (with blue tip) - 100 psi / 6.9 bar It is recommended to use oil with a viscosity of **15 or 20 WT**.

#### Brief Instructions

01. Remove the forks from the pit bike.
02. Release the air and unscrew the valve using a 9 mm socket.
03. Unscrew the small screw that prevents the lower part of the fork (where the wheel axle is inserted) from loosening.
04. Remove the upper part of the fork where the adjustment bolts are located.
05. Detach the lower part of the fork. Inside, there is a small cap with an Allen key fitting and two small holes. (The oil is located beneath it).
06. Unscrew the bolt and drain the oil.
07. Remove the upper part of the fork and extract the spring from the body. Wipe off the remnants of the old oil.
08. Set aside the inner part and thoroughly clean the inside of the body, paying special attention to checking the seals and dust cover.
09. Remove the cap under which the oil was located and wipe everything inside to ensure it is equally clean.
10. Then pour in the oil.
11. Replace the cap, and pump the fork several times to remove all air.
12. Screw the cap with an Allen bolt, tighten it. Remove excess oil.
13. Insert the inner part into the body, attach the lower part of the fork, tighten the bolt to prevent loosening, and install the valve.
14. Inflate the air.
15. Apply a generous amount of grease to the springs and return them to their place.
16. Screw on the top cap.
17. Install the forks on the pit bike.
