# Cylinder Head Inspection Guide

## Required Materials:
- A sufficiently large drain pan
- Simple Green or Kerosene

## Procedure:

1. **Preparation**: Ensure the cylinder head is removed from the engine.

2. **Exhaust Port Test**:
   - Carefully pour Simple Green or Kerosene into the exhaust port.
   - Observe for any leakage around the valve into the combustion chamber.

3. **Intake Port Test**:
   - Pour Simple Green or Kerosene into the intake port.
   - Monitor for any solvent seepage, which indicates the necessity for a valve job or the presence of bent valves.

### Note:
- If leakage is detected in either test, further inspection and repair of the valves are required.
