# Installing Rear Clutch Spring: A Technical Guide

Rear Clutch Maintenance for XR/CRF100-80, Pitster Pro GPX125, and ZS 140-155-170, Piranha YX 125-160

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Removing the Clutch Springs:**
   - Carefully unscrew the four bolts securing the clutch springs. Employ a cross pattern technique, akin to changing a car tire, to prevent any potential damage to the clutch plates.

2. **Reinstallation Process:**
   - Reverse the aforementioned procedure during reinstallation. Ensure the bolts are fully inserted.

3. **Securing the Bolts:**
   - Use a 1/4 drive ratchet or a nut driver tool of maximum size to gently tighten the bolts. This precaution helps in avoiding any breakage of the bolts and the towers.
