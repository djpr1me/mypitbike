# Pit Bike Engine Oil and Break-In Techniques

#### Recommended Oil for Engine Break-In

During the initial operation of the engine, it is advisable to use conventional oil (non-synthetic) to ensure the piston rings properly "seat" and seal against the cylinder walls. These engines feature steel sleeve or cast iron liner cylinders, which can become "glazed" due to the highly slippery properties of synthetic lubricants, potentially causing the engine to emit smoke.

We provide every engine and motorcycle customer with an informational email and include details in every sale. Below is an excerpt from that information:

These procedures are recommended for all motorcycle engines and pit bikes:

1. **Initial Oil Change**: Before starting the engine, replace the oil with 10w40 non-synthetic oil.
2. **Engine Break-In**: Operate the engine at low speeds with minimal loads for the first 2-4 hours. It is acceptable to increase the engine's revolutions, but avoid placing significant loads on the engine, such as climbing steep hills. Change the oil after the break-in period.

Once the engine has been properly broken in, you may switch to your preferred oil if desired. We recommend Maxima oil:

- Maxima Maxum 4 - Premium Break-In 4-Cycle Oil - 10w30 - 1L (part number: W-78-9974)
- Maxima Maxum 4 Premium 4-Cycle Oil - 10w40 - 1L (part number: W-78-9880)
