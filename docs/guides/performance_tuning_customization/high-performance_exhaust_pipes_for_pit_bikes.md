# High-Performance Exhaust Pipes for Pit Bikes

## Pipes for Japanese Minis

We provide a diverse selection of exhaust pipes tailored for Japanese mini bikes such as the CRF50, KLX110, and CRF110. These pipes are meticulously crafted to seamlessly fit these models, ensuring a straightforward installation. Additionally, we offer specific brands featuring larger headers, accommodating more substantial builds and, in the case of the CRF50, larger aftermarket engines.

## Pipes for Chinese Minis

### SSR, Piranha, Pitster Pro, and Others

Among Chinese pit bike manufacturers, only the LXR Pro Circuit Pipe has been specifically designed for a particular model. Other pit bikes may potentially accommodate pipes intended for Japanese minis, though a perfect fit is not guaranteed. Here are some common scenarios:

1. **Pitster Pro X2, SSR 110, and 125cc (50 base):** These models can accept the FMF Factory 4.1 at the head and bend, but a small two-hole bracket is required to mount the muffler.

2. **Pitster Pro X4 and SSR TX or other KLX 110 type bikes with KLX port motor:** These can also accept the FMF Factory 4.1 at the head and bend, necessitating a small two-hole bracket for muffler installation. However, if your X4 or TX bike features a round cam cover (Honda port), the FMF Factory 4.1 will not fit the head.

3. **SSR 125-140-160TR:** These models can accommodate the CRF70 FMF Factory 4.1, although FMF has discontinued this model.

### Recommendation

For those inquiring about fitting pipes on Chinese pit bikes, if your current pipe has a 28mm inner diameter, it is already a performance pipe of sorts. You may encounter difficulties fitting a pipe designed for Japanese minis. We recommend considering the high-performance VM26-606 carburetor we offer, as it represents a genuine performance enhancement for your bike.
