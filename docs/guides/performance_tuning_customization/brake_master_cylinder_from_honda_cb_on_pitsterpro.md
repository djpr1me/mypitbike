# Brake master cylinder from honda cb on pitsterpro

It so happened that the rear caliper overheated; the equipment is new, still not fully broken in and adjusted. As a result, the hydraulic line melted from the heat. I replaced the hose, but couldn't bleed it with the stock pump, tried both injecting and extracting with a syringe.

I gave up on it and bought a new brake system from a dismantler, reportedly from a Honda CB. At first glance, it seemed very nice and felt good too, with the hose and reservoir made of quality materials. The price was also reasonable: 1200 rubles.

It was immediately clear that it wouldn't fit the mounting points, so I took metal about 6mm thick and worked on it with an angle grinder, file, and drill with a tap. It bled instantly, and works well and precisely.
