# Installing and Adjusting Manual Clutches on CRF50/70

## Introduction

One of the most significant performance enhancements you can make to your XR or CRF 50 is to replace the stock semi-automatic clutch with a fully manual clutch. By incorporating a manual clutch, you can anticipate your 50 to accelerate more aggressively out of corners and achieve a quicker start from the line. For this guide, we have chosen the reliable 3-plate manual clutch kit from Honda Trail Bikes. This kit includes everything necessary except for the clutch lever and perch. With some time and patience, the Trail Bikes clutch is relatively straightforward to install and is well worth the effort.
