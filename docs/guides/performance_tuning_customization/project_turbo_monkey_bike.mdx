# Project turbo monkey bike

The British company **OORacing** specializes in the **modification of monkey bikes and pit bikes**. They operate a small family business with their own store and development department. Like larger companies, to maintain their brand and reputation, they have assembled a so-called showstopper - a turbocharged monkey bike based on a YX 170cc 4v engine.

More precise specifications and dyno charts are not provided, but we can observe the photos of the construction process, where the components and overall build quality are clearly visible.

And a video of the completed project, which has been named **Napier**.
