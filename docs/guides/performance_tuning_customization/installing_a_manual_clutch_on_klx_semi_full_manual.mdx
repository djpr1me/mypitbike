**Note:** Some aftermarket exhausts may obstruct the cable bracket. If this is the case with your exhaust, you can simply bend the bracket to clear the exhaust. The cable bracket can be bent back to clear pipes after it’s bolted on the engine using a dead blow hammer (be careful not to hit the case) or bend it off the engine in a vise with the same hammer. The pictures above reflect the bracket bent back slightly for that exhaust.

**Note:** Ensure the oil level sight glass is securely installed using high-quality silicone sealant.
