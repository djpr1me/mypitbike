# Lighting kit for pit bike

On the pages of our website, we have previously discussed how to install lights on a pit bike and the available ready-made solutions. Recently, however, we came across this particular kit.

This is a complete set for installation on a Honda CRF50 or virtually any pit bike in existence. The kit includes:

- A headlight with high/low beam
- Mounting rubbers
- Wiring
- A handlebar switch control
- A voltage regulator
- and a **Generator with a lighting coil**

Thus, the kit is genuinely suitable for any four-stroke pit bike, even if the generator does not have a lighting coil. Here is how the headlight looks on a pit bike
