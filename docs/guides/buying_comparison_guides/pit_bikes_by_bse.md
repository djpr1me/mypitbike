# Pit bikes by BSE

## BSE Pit Bikes: A Renowned Brand in Russia

Today, we discuss another prominent pit bike manufacturer in Russia, the company **BSE**.

## History

Established in 2002, **Zhejiang Bosuer Motion Apparatus CO., LTD** is a professional engineering factory located in Zhejiang, a flourishing city in southeastern China. The factory manufactures, develops, and exports motocross bikes, ATVs, scooters, pit bikes, and MiniGP models.

Since 2003, to meet market demands, the company has increasingly focused on the pit bike segment. BSE pit bikes draw from frames like the Honda CRF50, CRF70, KLX110, and Yamaha TTR. The skillful mechanics continually explore and develop new pit bike models. High quality, competitive pricing, and production control make BSE pit bikes an excellent choice in the Chinese motorcycle sector. Renowned for quality and reliability, these motorcycles have earned a solid reputation among customers. Export markets include Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and more.

## Market

BSE targets the European, Australian, and Canadian markets, where bikers are highly interested in racing pit bikes. Other regions, such as Africa, South America, **Russia**, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, actively show interest in BSE pit bikes. Many start their racing careers with these pit bikes, given BSE's vigorous collaboration and support for racing teams. As the Chinese market expands, Bosuer anticipates stable demand for its pit bikes.

## Assembly

The company operates a specialized assembly line for pit bike production in China. A designated quality control supervisor oversees each assembly phase, ensuring all parts are properly installed in sequence and without errors. After assembly, a quality-control engineer conducts a comprehensive check, test-driving every motorcycle to evaluate the engine, brakes, and other systems. The front wheel is detached and secured inside a metal frame, housing the pit bike before dispatch to stores.

## Product Branding

At Bosuerâ€™s factory, each pit bike undergoes customer-tailored branding. This could mean applying customer logos on parts like seats, engine covers, swingarms, and plastic trim. BSE can create completely unique pit bikes tailored to customer specifications.

## Design Works

Each year, BSE engineers design new pit bike models tailored to diverse markets. The factory can customize pit bikes to specific client needs. BSE remains open to collaboration and consistently seeks new partners.
