# New Honda MSX125 Pit Bike

## Honda's New Release: The Honda MSX125

The company **Honda** has unveiled a new motorcycle, building upon the foundation of the Honda Wave 125â€”a beloved model among Far East residents. Named the **Honda MSX125**, this pit bike features a fuel-injected engine with a 125cc capacity paired with a four-speed transmission. Enthusiasts of two-wheeled vehicles will recognize this engine from the budget-friendly Wave 125 model.

The **Honda MSX125** is propelled by a reliable single-cylinder, two-valve engine with an air cooling system, fuel injection, and an electric starter. Delivering 10 horsepower (7.2 kW) at 5500 revolutions per minute, the MSX engine is essentially a refined version of one of Honda's most robust and tested engines, with nearly a million units worldwide. Known for its durability and efficiency, this engine benefits from low-friction technology, enhancing longevity and notably reducing fuel consumption.

A backbone frame forms the primary structure of the moped. The **Honda MSX125** accommodates two riders, evident from its spacious seat and passenger footrests.

Production of this new Japanese model will occur at a Thai factory, with global sales anticipated, excluding the United States. The focus will be on countries where affordable two-wheeled vehicles are particularly favored.

The **Honda MSX125** serves as a "successor" to the Honda Monkey, millions of which found homes worldwide. The new model suggests a lineage with the "Monkey," having increased in size while maintaining a compact, lightweight, and agile moped design.
