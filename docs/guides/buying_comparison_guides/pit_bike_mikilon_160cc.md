# Pit Bike Mikilon 160cc

Hello everyone. I have become the proud owner of a Mikilon 160. Huge thanks to Dmitry (PITBIKEMARKET.RU). I acquired it for 60 rubles. I immediately disassembled and reassembled the pit bike to write this report. I'm writing everything honestly, as it is, feel free to ask questions. I can compare it with the Irbis and BFD 125.

Let me start with the drawbacks or shortcomings I noticed and how I addressed them:
- At first glance, the seat height seemed low at the rear, lower than the Irbis and BFD. This was resolved by tightening the spring shock absorber's support washer, raising the rear to the height of the Irbis, making it comfortable for my 185 cm.
- There is no protection for the rear shock absorber - either a cover for the shock or my favorite linoleum.
- The gear shift lever is inconvenient, even though it's aluminum - I got a lever from Forsage from Sergey, and it became super good.
- The clutch handle is uncomfortable - I got one from Forsage with tuning (foldable and short).
- The spark plug wire cap is weak; I accidentally touched it, and the bike started backfiring and sputtering. I adjusted the cap - everything is okay, haven't done anything else yet, might install a cap from Irbis.
- Lacked a washer on each side of the handlebar crossbar, it rattled - installed washers - everything is okay.
- Stickers were poorly applied, with bubbles - whatever, not aesthetic.

That's probably all for the shortcomings, let me write how it differs from the Irbis, apart from the price.

**Engine:**
- The 160 engine pulls like a locomotive, the power is insane, Zongshen rules + oil cooler.
- Mikuni 26 carburetor as standard!
- Starts with the clutch engaged in gear (very convenient in competitions).
- CNC chain (if I'm not mistaken in the name), though 420.
- The muffler is more attractive + super sound (like a Honda CRF 450), power is felt.
- The engine can be upgraded by replacing the piston with a 190 and a 4-valve head.

**Frame:**
- All bolts and fastenings are made of metal! Not like Irbis's plasticine, everything was conscientiously fastened from the factory.
- The frame is well-welded, found no flaws.
- The handlebar is decent, incomparable to Irbis's plasticine handlebar.
- The body plastic is soft, the tail is slightly longer.

**Attachments:**
- Excellent throttle handle.
- Front adjustable DNM suspension with 190 travel (nothing more to add).
- Rear DNM shock absorber 270 mm with a magical adjustment wheel that really works!
- Swingarm - aluminum with proper chain tension, very convenient.
- Aluminum rims + thick spokes.
- Tires - good Kenda!
- Front brake - 2 pistons, the rear pedal lever is above the pedal - doesn't interfere. The brakes brake!

Wow, so many goodies, I'm drooling again). This setup should be perfect for competitions. After two races, the Irbis started to gradually fall apart, it's not meant for this. I recommend it to everyone, as finding a competitor for 60 rubles at the moment is unrealistic.

Besides Motosport, I checked the availability of pit bikes in various stores, but in Moscow, 150cc and above are not available from any known to me, neither Mototekhnika, nor Jas, nor AVM, nor ScooterMag, etc. And in Kashira, when they opened the warehouse - 50-60 units of combat equipment! If anyone needs, I can provide the seller's contacts.

After a couple of months of use, the following were identified and added:
- Mudguard for the shock absorber
- Engine mounting bolts to the frame constantly loosen, maintenance after each race
- Pedal mount bends - profile welded in support
- Rear brake disappeared - needs bleeding

Everything else is intact and works fine! Once again, I recommend it to everyone.
