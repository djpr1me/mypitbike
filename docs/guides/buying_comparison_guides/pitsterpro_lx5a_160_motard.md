# PitsterPro LX5A 160 Motard

I placed an order in mid-August at Pitmoto, making a 30% down payment. They promised an earlier delivery, but the bikes arrived in Moscow precisely at the contract's end date. Sales commenced on November 1st. After bank transfers, holidays, and delivery, I picked it up on the 11th. Just assembled it. Haven't started it yet. Here's what I can say right away.

It's a new model from 2012. Included is a pleasant bonus - an hour meter. Many bolts are not tightened, but that's fixable. The welds are not neat. The frame is metal. The bike itself is heavy. Subjectively, it feels about one and a half times heavier than the aluminum BSE. In size, it's almost like a full-sized motocross bike. There might be issues with the documents on the road.

The engine is new. The carburetor is new. Judging by forum reviews of previous models, where the rear brake didn't work out of the box, the brake cylinder is also new and grips well. By default, there's a zero-resistance sponge filter. The filter box needs to be purchased separately. The diameter of the pipe and carburetor differ by about 5-7 mm, which can be resolved with a spacer. There's no fuel filter either, but that's solvable.

The spark plug in the engine is NGK. The right side of the wing doesn't fit after installing the filter box. The pipe and the box itself obstruct it. The mounting ears need to be bent slightly. The plastic is modified with a file and rasp.

The suspensions initially seemed soft. The rear shock is indeed DNM, without a reservoir, with only rebound speed adjustment. The handguard mounts on the handlebars with difficulty. The handlebars are tapered, thickening towards the center, and the mounting diameter is just enough. Almost all fastenings have washers to prevent nuts from loosening. The main fastenings (engine, swingarm, subframe) are bolted tightly.

For some reason, there's grease on the other bolts, but after removing it and tightening with Loctite, almost all bolts are secure, with no wobbling or play. Everything turns, presses, and works without creaks or signs of imminent failure.

I can't comment on the riding characteristics yet. I need to fill it with proper oil and break it in. If anyone has questions, feel free to ask, even in private messages. I'll try to answer everything.
