**YCF** traces its roots to the collaboration between French motocross rider **Yannick Coquard** and French minibike enthusiast engineer **Dimitri Bera**, currently residing in China. Together, they developed the first YCF pit bike with the goal of providing affordable motorcycles accessible to all. The first pit bikes were imported into France for testing and subsequent performance and reliability improvements.

#### 2004 Pit Bikes Debut in France

Thanks to several advantages over full-sized motorcycles, pit bikes quickly gained popularity in France:

- Lightweight for easy transport
- Affordable pricing
- Simple and inexpensive maintenance
- Ideal for beginners learning to ride
- A fun sport accessible to everyone
- Great for improving driving skills
- Train year-round, even during winter

#### 2005/2006 First Model Lineup

The initial lineup consisted of three models. In 2005, David joined the company, taking responsibility for the technical development of pit bikes and revamping spare part shipping and after-sales service processes.

#### 2006 Collaboration with Marzocchi

YCF also teamed up with **One Industries** for graphics preparation on plastics. The export range expanded to Austria and Morocco.

#### 2009 China Factory Formation

YCF becomes a full-fledged pit bike manufacturer.

![YCF Factory in China](../../../static/img/3e95ba.png)

A factory spanning 2,500 square meters was built, establishing spare part production for post-warranty service and repair. An assembly line was set up for maximum quality. The workforce consists of 30 employees. The motorcycle lineup expanded to seven models.

#### 2010 Brand Establishment

Two new importers appeared in Finland and Spain. The lineup expanded to nine pit bikes. All parts are produced in-house. Collaboration with **Elka**, a Canadian suspension element manufacturer, began.

YCF created its own testing ground in China.

The factory area expanded to 5,000 square meters, and staff grew to 50. Land was leased for a CNC parts production plant (subframes, triple clamps, etc.).

#### 2011 Establishment of CNC Parts Production

YCF invests in a CNC parts manufacturing plant, occupying 600 square meters at the Chinese factory. The trained staff numbers six. Investments in equipment procurement commenced, leading to the production of anodized aluminum parts (hubs, pegs, shift levers, fuel caps, triple clamps, sprockets).
