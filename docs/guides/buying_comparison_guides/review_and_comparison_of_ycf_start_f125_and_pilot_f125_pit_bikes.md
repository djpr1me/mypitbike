# Review and Comparison of YCF Start F125 and Pilot F125 Pit Bikes

The fundamental distinction between these two minibikes lies in two parameters: the frame and the rear shock absorber.

The Pilot's frame is semi-perimeter and boasts excellent qualities of accessibility to components, weight, and reliability, not to mention a certain resilience that can be discerned. The shock absorber on the Pilot F125 is longer in travel and larger in spring size. The wheel on the Pilot tucks under the fender (as seen in the F150 photo). The F150 model is even taller and longer, designed for both cross-country and track riding.

The Start model is suitable for those who are not tall and are not ready to spend extra money on a different frame and suspension. The F series frames personally evoke admiration in me. The suspension on the Start models is more geared towards fourteen-year-old boys with bright eyes racing along country roads. The rear shock absorber with tight spring coils hints at riding on flat tracks (areas for riding without pronounced terrain) and is intended to work only on the wheel's grip with the road.

The forks on these models differ in length and color, with the YCF Pilot F125 designed for slightly longer travel than the Start F125. Both forks lack adjustments, which significantly simplifies operation and extends service life.

These two motorcycles are equipped with engines of the same model, YX 125 YX 10hp type 154FMI. An excellent option with a cast cylinder of high wear resistance. The diameter and stroke of the piston: 54 x 54 mm. A good geometric ratio that leads to maximum efficiency not only in engine power but also in piston durability. The gearbox is standard, as with most pit bikes: N1234. The only drawback of this engine is the ability to start it only from neutral gear, which is conveniently located at the very bottom.

The engine power is relatively high, about ten horsepower. The engine has plenty of revolutions, spinning up to a cutoff at 10,500 after the necessary break-in and valve adjustment. Torque characteristics can be increased by changing the volume to 140 cubic centimeters, which will increase fuel consumption and require carburetor refinement; otherwise, all mounts and seating places are identical to the 125.

Overall, it can be said that a full-fledged racing pit bike can be built on the F-Series frame.

First of all, for this motorcycle, I recommend protecting the components from dirt. Install possible sealing sponges on the brake pedal, at the drain hole of the crankcase. For this, simple sponge material is suitable. Create a protective cover for the carburetor, for which car mudguards are excellent. Such a cover is also necessary for the rear shock absorber, additionally wrapping it with neoprene sleeves. Replace the oil in the fork and shock absorber.

YCF motorcycles are renowned for their reliability among other manufacturers, but progress does not stand still, and many have already caught up with this quality.
