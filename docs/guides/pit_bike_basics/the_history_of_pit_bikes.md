# The History of Pit Bikes

Initially, the term "pit bike" referred to bicycles used by racers and mechanics to navigate the pit areas during competitions (pit â€“ from English). The pits are designated areas on a racetrack for working on cars or motorcycles during training, testing, and races. In the pits, vehicles are prepared for the track, including quick parameter checks, suspension adjustments, aerodynamic element tuning, and field repairs. The pit area also includes the pit lane, where vehicles stop during pit stops.

In the 1950s, people began using classic mini bikes to move around the pits. These were rather primitively constructed motorcycles, lacking suspension and featuring makeshift brakes, with power generally not exceeding 5 horsepower. The mini bikes were powered by Briggs & Stratton engines, which provided relatively high speed.

The four-stroke horizontal engine, which we now consider standard in the pit bike world, gained popularity thanks to the legendary Honda Super Cub 50 model. Millions of these mopeds were produced. Wikipedia cites this model as the most successful in motorcycle industry history. Mechanics and racers enjoyed using these motorcycles to move around the pits. However, they were not well-suited for cross-country tracks due to their design features.

This changed with the release of the renowned Honda Z50 mini bike model in 1968, which gained popularity among mechanics servicing motorcycles on cross-country tracks. The Honda Z50 was the first small Honda motorcycle model designed specifically for off-road use. Its main feature was its compact size, allowing it to fit in the corner of almost any trailer. With regular model updates, such as the addition of rear shock absorbers in 1970, it gained popularity, and people began to realize the thrill and enjoyment such a small motorcycle could provide.

The Z50 was succeeded by models like the XR 50R, CRF 50, and the mini motard version of the XR 50, which was legalized for public roads. This motorcycle quickly became the first bike for many famous names. Chinese manufacturers swiftly began copying these models. Most riders agree that the original Japanese versions of pit bikes are far more durable, better, and more skillfully constructed. However, it should be noted that the engine installed on Honda motorcycles is produced in China at the Jailing factory. Additionally, Chinese engines from manufacturers like Lifan or YX have proven themselves very well in professional sports.
