# What is a Pit Bike?

**What is a pit bike?** A pit bike is a type of motorcycle designed for enthusiasts of mini-motocross or mini-supermoto, as well as for beginner motorcyclists.

**How does a pit bike differ from other motorcycles?** The rear wheel size does not exceed **12"**, and the four-stroke engine is cooled **exclusively by air**, or through air-oil cooling. The engine mounting is horizontal, open type only. In European competitions, the engine capacity is limited to 150cc by regulations, although currently, there are no such restrictions in Russia.

**What advantages do pit bikes have compared to larger motorcycles?** The minimized geometry makes the motorcycle accessible for both children and adults. Small wheels and a relatively low-displacement engine (but still with sufficient power) make it easier to learn motorcycle control. Things like shifting gears, feeling the clutch, discerning surfaces, and braking correctly can all be practiced without putting serious strain on the rider.

While comparatively safe for novices, it can be just as challenging in the hands of a professional. It's affordable (financially accessible and easy to maintain), and simple to operate. Pit bikes allow newcomers to experience the essence of larger motorcycles and their power, thus helping them make informed choices. For those wanting to pursue motorsports, it minimizes unnecessary headaches associated with full-sized motorcycles that often demand considerable investments.

A pit bike is a small entry into the world of competitive sports. Here, novices are enthusiastically welcomed, and each individual can showcase their strength and effort. Competitions provide thrills equivalent to major sports. Many who participate for the first time never forget the thrilling rush that athletes worldwide seek.

Minimotocross is a very young discipline, gaining popularity in Europe and genuine admiration from audiences. It's important to note that pit bikes, like other accessible motorsports (e.g., scooter racing), are far more relatable to our society than professional motorsports. By attracting new people and the public, a solid foundation for discovering young talents is established.

How many children, under parental or motorcycle club guidance, reach professional sports? What's the percentage of youth who progress to larger motorcycles? As observed, many children stop doing motocross for various reasons—the main being adolescence and fear of bigger motorcycles. Many engaged in sports as children quit as they wanted to spend more time with friends or focus on whatever intrigued their young minds.

Adolescents often seek social approval or respect from friends and older peers. Unfortunately, motorsports are less understood among children today, much like respecting a war veteran grandparent or a hardworking parent is forgotten. However, subcultures celebrating freestyle motocross champions, skate and BMX stars, youth band leaders, and others are far more popular.

Current development follows this trend because behind the "reckless" behavior, flashy clothing, and popular gatherings lies a hidden promotion of a healthy lifestyle. Young people begin to realize the importance of fitness over alcohol or nicotine. Priorities become clear: enjoying a casual drink with friends and missing training means not standing on the podium—a taste of victory, especially when acknowledged by friends, is irreplaceable.

If they are accustomed to driving since childhood, entering competitions, adolescence ends with them re-evaluating life choices and living with less parental stress. A robust motorsport athlete—physically and mentally mature—can handle a larger motorcycle, still requiring some adjustment because riding a pit bike is significantly different from a big motorcycle. It's far better than quitting sports and wasting years of training.

This sport officially hit Russia in 2008 when BMX pro-riders Pavel Voitov (Moscow) and Vlad Mazepov (Saint Petersburg) started riding pit bikes. They continue to develop this missing link in our Russian motor sports culture to this day.

There are five commonly accepted pit bike disciplines:

1. **Cross/Supercross** - The most developed and core discipline. Riding on motocross tracks and jumps, enhanced suspension, tires with deep tread.
2. **Supermoto** - Riding on asphalt tracks, slick tires, improved brakes, and special suspension settings.
3. **Park** - The newest and least developed discipline. Riding in skate parks. New technologies have significantly reduced bike weight, allowing tricks on specialized structures. Similar history with the BMX bike.
4. **Street** - An illegal discipline. Trials and riding on streets, stairs, walls, and various structures. Pegs, reinforced frames, sliders. Parallel to BMX.
5. **Stunt** - A popular discipline. Riding in open spaces and performing various tricks—wheelies, stoppies, etc. Many professional stunters consider pit bikes essential in their garage.
