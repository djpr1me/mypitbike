# Important Guidelines for Starting Your Motorcycle

## Initial Setup

Consider positioning your motorcycle on a stand to ensure a stable starting point until you gain confidence.

## Starting Procedure

1. **Activate Both Fuel and Choke**  
   Ensure both the fuel and choke are turned on.

2. **Throttle Management**  
   Refrain from opening the throttle. Avoid turning the throttle.

3. **Kickstart Technique**  
   Allow the starter to return to its original position, then deliver a full, strong, and swift kick all the way through.  
   Repeat as necessary.  
   Avoid rapid kicking.

4. **Warm Engine**  
   Once the engine is warm, do not use the choke.

## Addressing a Flooded Engine

1. **Remove the Spark Plug**  
   If the engine is flooded, remove the spark plug.

2. **Clear the Engine**  
   Kick the engine over approximately ten times with the spark plug removed.

3. **Install a New Spark Plug**  
   Insert a new spark plug.

## Additional Tip

Occasionally, it may be beneficial to slightly open the throttle to allow a small amount of air in. Do this sparingly.
