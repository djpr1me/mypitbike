# O-Ring Guidelines

When undertaking a rebuild using gasket kits, it is imperative to **avoid using stock O-rings** on the cylinder base and cylinder head sealing surfaces. 

### Essential Steps:

1. **Oil All Gaskets**: Ensure that all gaskets are adequately oiled to enhance their sealing capabilities.
2. **Re-Torque the Head**: After the initial start-up, it is crucial to re-torque the head to maintain optimal sealing and performance.

### Additional Tips:

- **Sealant Usage**: Employ Honda Bond or an equivalent sealant only if leaks are detected. This will ensure a secure and leak-free assembly.
