# Understanding CDI Wiring Diagram

Pit bike engines utilize a variety of CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) units, which essentially serve as the central processing unit of the system. Proper wiring of CDI boxes to the respective electrical components is crucial to generate the spark necessary for engine operation. Each connection point corresponds to a specific wire that links to its designated component.

When installing new engines or swapping out existing ones, it is advisable to have a comprehensive understanding of all the components involved and the precise method of connecting them back to the CDI unit.
