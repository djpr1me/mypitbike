# How to Measure a Bearing

Bearings are characterized by three primary dimensions: the inner diameter, the outer diameter, and the width. These measurements are always specified in metric units.

## Key Dimensions

- **A**: Inner Diameter
- **B**: Outer Diameter
- **C**: Width

## Example

Consider the industry standard bearing size 6003 2RS. The designation "2RS" indicates the presence of two rubber seals, one on each side, designed to retain lubrication and prevent the ingress of dirt.
