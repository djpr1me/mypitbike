# Valve clearances

For most pit bikes, the following valve clearance settings are typically suitable:

* **Intake** — .003" (0.08mm)  
* **Exhaust** — .005" (0.13mm) or .004" (0.1mm)

These settings are a general guideline and may not be appropriate for all models. It's crucial to consult your specific pit bike's owner manual or service guide for accurate specifications and instructions. Proper maintenance, including checking and adjusting valve clearances, ensures optimal performance and longevity of your engine.
