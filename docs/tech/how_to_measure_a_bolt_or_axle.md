# How to Measure a Bolt or Axle

In accordance with industry standards, the measurement of a bolt is taken from the shaft, not the head.

All bolts and axles provided by us adhere to this measurement method.

A simple technique to determine the size is to use the open end of a wrench on the shaft. For instance, a 15mm open-end wrench will fit a 15mm axle shaft.
