# Cradle Frame Information

## Enhancing Pit Bike Structural Integrity

Many pit bikes, such as the Honda CRF50 and Kawasaki KLX110, lack a cradle frame. In these models, the foot peg bar is affixed directly to the aluminum engine block, without any reinforcement from the main frame.

## Solutions for Improved Support

1. **Cradle Frame Add-ons**: We offer products designed to enhance these bikes by providing additional support and structural integrity, specifically tailored for pit bike usage. These are known as Cradle Frames.

2. **Stock Pit Bikes with Cradle Frames**: We also provide pit bikes that come equipped with cradle frames as standard. These frames offer support to both the engine and foot pegs from beneath, ensuring a safer and more robust riding experience for adult riders.
