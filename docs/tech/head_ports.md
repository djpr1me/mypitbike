# Exhaust Pipes and Head Ports

When installing pit bike engines, you may encounter various types of exhaust pipes and head ports:

1. **Honda Type**: 6mm stud with angle "A"
2. **KLX Type**: 8mm stud with angle "B"

These two types differ only slightly in angle. Although they do not directly interchange, they are sufficiently similar to be adapted to fit through various methods. We offer two useful solutions:

1. **Grinding the Pipe Collar End**: Modify the pipe collar end to align with the required angle.
2. **Copper Exhaust Gaskets**: Utilize 2-3 crushable exhaust gaskets stacked together to bridge the gap.
