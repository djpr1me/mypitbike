### Fuel

The capacity of the fuel tank is 3.8 L (1.0 US gal). To open the fuel tank cap, pull out the breather hose from the hole in the number plate and turn the tank cap counterclockwise.

Avoid filling the tank in the rain or where heavy dust is blowing so that the fuel does not get contaminated.

![Image](../../../static/img/da55d0f09cf6594d0a81626719d8b902bf3cd40d7b62ed5d8e4d5d47035ebf19.jpg)

#### A **WARNING**

Gasoline is extremely flammable and can be explosive under certain conditions. Always stop the engine and do not smoke. Make sure the area is well ventilated and free from any source of flame or sparks; this includes any appliance with a pilot light. After refueling, make sure the fuel tank cap is closed securely. If gasoline is spilled on the fuel tank, wipe it off immediately.

### Fuel Type

Use clean, fresh unleaded gasoline with a minimum Antiknock index of 87. The Antiknock Index is posted on service station pumps in the USA. The octane rating of a gasoline is a measure of its resistance to detonation or "knocking." The Antiknock Index is an average of the Research Octane Number (RON) and the Motor Octane Number (MON) as shown in the table below.

| Octane Rating Method        | Minimum Rating |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| (RON + MON) Antiknock index | 87             |
| Research octane Number (RON)| 91             |

**CAUTION**: different brand of gasoline of a higher octane rating. If this condition is allowed to continue, it can lead to severe engine

#### Fuels Containing Oxygenates

Gasoline frequently contains oxygenates (alcohols and ethers) especially in areas of the U.S. and Canada which are required to sell such reformulated fuels as part of a strategy to reduce exhaust emissions.

The types and volume of fuel oxygenates approved for use in unleaded gasoline by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency include a broad range of alcohols and ethers, but only two components have seen any significant level of commercial use.

Gasoline/Alcohol Blends - Gasoline containing up to 10% ethanol (alcohol produced from agricultural products such as corn), also known as "gasohol" is approved for use.

**CAUTION**
Avoid using blends of unleaded gasoline and methanol (wood alcohol) whenever possible, and never use gasohol containing more than 5% methanol. Fuel system damage and performance problems may result.

Gasoline/Ether Blends - The most common ether is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). You may use gasoline containing up to 15% MTBE.

**NOTE**

Other oxygenates approved for use in unleaded gasoline include TAME (up to 16.7%) and ETBE (up to 17.2%). Fuel containing these oxygenates can also be used in your Pitsterpro.

**CAUTION**
than the minimum specified by Pitsterpro. Never use "gasohol" with more than 10% ethanol or more than 5% methanol. Gasoline containing methanol must also be blended with co-solvents and corrosion inhibitors. Certain ingredients of gasoline may cause paint fading or damage. Be extra careful not to spill gasoline or gasoline oxygenate blends during refueling.

### Fuel Tap

The fuel tap has three positions: OFF, ON, and RES (reserve). For normal operation, turn the fuel tap lever to the ON position. If the fuel runs out with the tap in the ON position, the last 0.5 L (0.13 US gal) of fuel can be used by turning the tap lever to the RES position.

![Fuel Tap](../../../static/img/d786ed6a50ba2dcc57110ebc11d64cec29f4fb1aa51b94abef9eddac95f9331d.jpg)

A. Fuel Tap C. OFF Position B. ON Position D. RES Position

Turn the fuel tap lever to the OFF position when the fuel tank is removed for maintenance and adjustments or the motorcycle is stored for a long time.

**NOTE**

Since riding distance is limited when on RES, refuel at the earliest opportunity.
Make certain that the fuel tap is turned to ON (Not RES) after filling up the fuel tank.

**WARNING**

Practice operating the fuel tap with the motorcycle stopped. To prevent an accident, you should be able to operate the fuel tap while riding without taking your eyes off the road. Be careful not to touch the hot engine while operating the fuel tap.

### Engine Stop Switch

The engine stop switch is located on the left side of the handlebar. For ordinary engine stoppage a# Starting the Engine

Shift the transmission into neutral by pushing the shift pedal down until the motorcycle rolls freely.

**NOTE**

This motorcycle will start in gear. Disengage the engine by engaging the clutch or placing transmission in neutral before starting.

Turn the fuel tap lever to the ON position.

A. Kick Pedal Once the engine starts wait until the engine is thoroughly warmed up then push in the choke knob.

**NOTE**

- When the engine is already warm or on a hot day, open the throttle partly instead of using the choke knob.
- If the engine is flooded, kick the engine over with the throttle fully open until it starts.

### Moving Off

1. Shift into 1st gear.
2. Open the throttle slowly.

### Shifting Gears

1. Close the throttle completely.
2. Shift into the next higher or lower gear.
3. Open the throttle slowly.

**WARNING**

When shifting down to a lower gear, do not shift at such a high speed that the engine r/min (rpm) jumps excessively. Not only can this cause engine damage, but the rear wheel may skid and cause an accident.

### Stopping the Motorcycle

For maximum deceleration, close the throttle and apply both front and rear brakes. Independent use of the front or rear brake may be advantageous in certain circumstances. Shift down progressively to ensure good engine response at all speeds.

### Break-In

The first one hour that the motorcycle is ridden is designed as the break-in period. If the motorcycle is not used carefully during this period, you may very well end up with a broken down instead of a broken in motorcycle.

Do not start moving or race the engine immediately after starting it, even if the engine is already warm. Run the engine for two or three minutes at idle speed to give the oil a chance to work up into all the engine parts.

Avoid the quick acceleration or starting and drive prudently for the first one hour of operation. Let the motorcycle cool completely. The motorcycle is ready for regular operation after this procedure is carried out.

### Air Cleaner

Inspect and adjust in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart.

Inspection and adjustment should be done only by a competent mechanic following the instructions in the Service Manual.

An air cleaner that is dirty or clogged can cause a plethora of problems including poor air intake, low engine power, increased fuel usage, and an increased incidence of fouled spark plugs.

To clean and service the air cleaner, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Remove the housing cover by unfastening the attaching clamp screw (A)
2. Remove air cleaner
3. Thoroughly wash with dish soap. Remove excess liquid and let dry for 24 hours prior to reinstallation.
4. Visually examine the air cleaner. If damaged, replace with a new air cleaner.
5. Once dry, apply a thin layer of approved air cleaner oil. Remove the excess oil.
6. Reinstall the air cleaner by fastening the attaching clamp screw.

**WARNING**

A clogged air cleaner may enable dirt and other residue to enter the carburetor and negatively affect the throttle. A malfunctioning throttle may cause injury and even death.

![**WARNING**](../../../static/img/46aa40f91a95f186bc1384ed6d07813c530717f66b0eb21c2f74b0084dfd84ba.jpg)

- A. Dust cover
- B. Adjuster C. Locknut

Tighten the locknut. Reinstall the rubber boot. If the free play cannot be set with the adjuster on the upper end of the throttle cable, pull the rubber boot off the top of the carburetor and make the necessary free play adjustment with the adjuster on the lower end of the cable. Then, tighten the locknut and reinstall the rubber boot.

Check if the throttle grip moves smoothly from full open to close, and the throttle closes quickly and completely in all steering positions by the return spring. If not, check the throttle cable routing, grip free play, and cable damage. Then lubricate the throttle cable. With the engine idling, turn the handlebar both ways and check if handlebar movement changes the idling speed. If so, the throttle cable may be improperly adjusted or incorrectly routed, or damaged. Be sure to correct any of these conditions before riding.

### Throttle Grip

The throttle grip controls the throttle valve. If the throttle grip has excessive play due to either cable stretch or maladjustment, it will cause a delay in throttle response, especially at low engine speed. Also, the throttle valve may not open fully at full throttle. On the other hand, if the throttle grip has no play, the throttle will be hard to control, and the idle speed will be erratic. Check the throttle grip play in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart, and adjust the play if necessary.

### Inspection

Check that the throttle grip turns smoothly and there is 2-3 mm (0.080-0.12 in) throttle grip play.

After making these clarifications and formatting adjustments, the text should be ready for display.En lightly turning the throttle grip back and forth.

Adjust the idling speed to 1400 ± 100 r/min (rpm) by turning the idling adjusting screw. Open and close the throttle a few times to make sure that the idling speed does not change. Readjust if necessary. With the engine idling, turn the handlebar to each side. If handlebar movement changes the idling speed, the throttle cable may be improperly adjusted or incorrectly routed, or it may be damaged. Be sure to correct any of these conditions before riding.

**WARNING**

Operation with a damaged throttle cable could result in an unsafe riding condition.

### Drive Chain

The drive chain must be checked, adjusted, and lubricated for safety and to prevent excessive wear. If the chain becomes badly worn or misadjusted—either too loose or too tight—the chain could jump off the sprockets or break.

**WARNING**

A chain that breaks or jumps off the sprockets could snag on the engine sprocket or lock the rear wheel, severely damaging the motorcycle and causing it to go out of control.

![image](../../../static/img/370ebc14c00d532d63b77fc47747aaf10c64c2766a631e148844de283d41b145.jpg)

- A. D: 5mm (0.2 in)
- B. Hollow
- C. Chain Guard
- D. Push Up

### Chain Slack Inspection

Set the motorcycle up on its side stand. Rotate the rear wheel to find the position where the chain is tightest (Because it wears unevenly) and measure the maximum chain slack as follows. Push up the chain midway between the engine sprocket and rear wheel sprocket. The drive chain slack is that the drive chain is pushed out within 0.5 mm (0.2 in) from the hollow of the chain guard.

If the drive chain is too tight or too loose, adjust it so that the chain slack will be within the standard value.

### Drive Chain Slack

| Standard | 0-5mm (0-0.2 in) |

### Chain Slack Adjustment

Remove the cotter pin from the torque link nut and loosen the torque link nut.

### Drive Chain Adjustment

1. Loosen axle nut (A).
2. Loosen lock nut (B) on both sides of motorcycle.
3. Turn the chain adjuster nuts (C) on both sides an equal number of turns to increase or decrease chain slack.
4. Tighten lock nuts on both sides of motorcycle.
5. Recheck chain slack.

**WARNING**

A worn chain can lead to an accident by coming off the sprockets and hanging up on moving parts. Serious injury or death may occur.

Checking your drive chain and associated parts is essential for proper maintenance. Please review the following information to ensure compliance with the Maintenance Schedule:

1. It is imperative to replace the chain if it stretches by 2% of its original length. The most effective means by which to measure the chain is by examining part of it (20 links).
2. Make sure the chain is tight using the chain adjusters.
3. Then measure 20 links. Take your measurement from the center of the first pin to the center of the 21st pin. If this measurement exceeds the service limit then it's time to replace the chain.

Gasoline, brake fluid, and coolant will damage the finish of painted and plastic surfaces: wash them off immediately.
Avoid wire brushes, steel wool, and all other abrasive pads or brushes.
Use care when washing the plastic parts as they can easily be scratched.
Avoid using pressure washers; water can penetrate seals and electrical components and damage your motorcycle.
Avoid spraying water in delicate areas such as in air intakes, carburetors, brake components, electrical components, muffler outlets, and fuel tank openings.

### Washing Your Motorcycle

Rinse your bike with cold water from a garden hose to remove any loose dirt.
Mix a mild neutral detergent (designed for motorcycles or automobiles) and water in a bucket. Use a soft cloth or sponge to wash your motorcycle. If needed, use a mild degreaser to remove any oil or grease buildup.
After washing, rinse your motorcycle thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining soap residue or dirt particles that could scratch the surface.

Make sure to follow the specified torque settings when working on your motorcycle to ensure everything is securely fastened and safe for operation.sidue (residue from the detergent can damage parts of your motorcycle).

Use a soft cloth to dry your motorcycle. As you dry, inspect your motorcycle for chips and scratches. Do not let the water air dry as this can damage the painted surfaces.

Start the engine and let it idle for several minutes. The heat from the engine will help dry moist areas.

Carefully ride your motorcycle at a slow speed and apply the brakes several times. This helps dry the brakes and restores them to normal operating performance.

Lubricate the drive chain to prevent rusting.

**NOTE**

After riding in an area where the roads are salted or near the ocean, immediately wash your motorcycle with cold water. Do not use warm water as it accelerates the chemical reaction of the salt. After drying, apply a corrosion protection spray on all metal and chrome surfaces to prevent corrosion.

### Painted Surfaces

After washing your motorcycle, coat painted surfaces, both metal and plastic, with a commercially available motorcycle/automotive wax. Wax should be applied once every three months or as conditions require. Avoid surfaces with satin or flat finishes. Always use nonabrasive products and apply them according to the instructions on the container.

Other Plastic Parts

After washing use a soft cloth to gently dry plastic parts. When dry, treat the non-painted plastic parts with an approved plastic cleaner/polisher product.

**CAUTION**

Plastic parts may deteriorate and brake if they come in contact with chemical substances or household cleaning products such as gasoline, brake fluid, window cleaners, thread-locking agents, or other harsh chemicals. If a plastic part comes in contact with any harsh chemical substance, wash it off immediately with water and a mild neutral detergent, and then inspect for damage. Avoid using abrasive pads or brushes to clean plastic parts, as they will damage the

### Chrome and Aluminum

Chrome and uncoated aluminum parts can be treated with a chrome/aluminum polish. Coated aluminum should be washed with a mild neutral detergent and finished with a spray polish. Aluminum wheels, both painted and unpainted can be cleaned with special non-acid based wheel spray cleaners.

### Leather, Vinyl, and Rubber

If your motorcycle has leather accessories special care must be taken. Use a leather cleaner/treatment to clean and care for leather accessories. Washing leather parts with detergent and water will damage them, shortening their life.

Vinyl parts should be washed with the rest of the motorcycle and then treated with a vinyl treatment.

The sidewalls of tires and other rubber components should be treated with a rubber protectant to help prolong their useful life.

**WARNING**

Special care must be taken not to get any rubber protectant on the tire's tread surface when treating tires. This may decrease the tire's ability to maintain contact with the road surface causing the ride# 60 MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT

### Lubrication

Lubricate the areas shown in the illustrations of this section with either motor oil or regular grease in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart and whenever the vehicle has been operated under wet or rainy conditions, especially after using a high-pressure spray washer. Before lubricating a part, clean off any rust with rust remover and wipe off any grease, oil, dirt, or grime.

### General Lubrication

Apply motor oil to the following pivots:
- Side Stand

### Drive Chain Lubrication

Lubrication is also necessary after riding through rain or on wet tracks, or any time that the chain appears dry. A heavy oil such as SAE 90 is preferred to a lighter oil because it will stay on the chain longer and provide better lubrication. Apply oil to the side of the rollers so that it will penetrate to the rollers and bushings. Wipe off any excess oil.

Clean the entire vehicle thoroughly.
Run the engine for about five minutes to warm the oil, shut it off and drain the engine oil.

**WARNING**:

Motor oil is a toxic substance. Dispose of used oil properly. Contact your local authorities for approved disposal methods or possible recycling.

Install the engine oil drain plug and fill in fresh engine oil. Empty the fuel tank and empty the carburetor float bowl. (The fuel will deteriorate if left for a long time.)

Remove the spark plug and spray fogging oil, directly into the cylinder. Kick the engine over slowly a few times to coat the cylinder wall. Install the spark plug.

Lubricate the drive chain and all the cables.
Spray oil on all unpainted metal surfaces to prevent rusting. Avoid getting oil on rubber parts or in the brakes.

Lift the motorcycle on a box or stand so that both wheels are raised off the ground. (If this cannot be done, put boards under the front and rear wheels to keep dampness away from the tire rubber.)

Place a plastic bag over the muffler and secure with a rubber band to prevent moisture from entering.
Cover the motorcycle to keep dust and dirt away from it.

**WARNING**:

Gasoline is extremely flammable and can be explosive under certain conditions. Always stop the engine and do not smoke. Make sure the area is well ventilated and free from any source of flame or sparks; this includes any appliance with a pilot light. Gasoline is a toxic substance. Dispose of gasoline properly. Contact your local authorities for approved disposal methods.
