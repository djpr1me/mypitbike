## Check-ups, Adjustment and Maintenance

### Lubricating Oil Checking

The vehicle should be checked for engine lubrication oil before driving each day. The oil level should be between the upper and lower lines of the oil gauge fitted in a screw plug, which is on the right cover of the crankcase.

1. Set the motorcycle vertically on the ground, screw off the oil gauge plug, wipe the oil gauge rod clean, and then insert the unit into the crankcase again to check the oil level. To do this, there is no need to screw the oil gauge plug into its hole in the crankcase.

2. Add lubricating oil up to the upper line when needed, but do not overfill.

3. Finally, screw on the oil gauge plug tightly. For details, please see the attached chart. Lubricating oils of different viscosity shall be employed in different regions and at different temperatures.

**Caution:**
>Never start the engine when there is insufficient lubricating oil. Otherwise, it will cause harm to the engine.

### Lubricating Oil Recommendations

The lubricating oil is an important factor affecting the performance and service life of the engine. For this vehicle is used the gasoline engine lubricating oil fusually known as machine oil for vehicles) specified in China National Standard GB485-81. kis not permitted to use ordinary machine oil, vegetable oil or crude castor oil.

Lubricating oils of different viscos ity shall be cmployed in differcnt regions and at different temperatures.

For details please see attached chart.

## Instructions for Storage

When the motorcycle is not to be used for a long period, such as during winter, certain steps should be taken to prevent malfunction and damage to its components, which might be caused by prolonged storage. Besides, proper maintenance should be carried out before long-term storage to ensure it is not forgotten when the vehicle is put back into use.

1. Change engine oil and oil filter.

2. Drain off fuel from the fuel tank and carburetor. Spray atomized anti-rust oil onto the inside wall of the tank and then close the tank.

**Attention:**
If the storage will last for more than one month, fuel in the carburetor must be fully drained. This is very important because it will help ensure that the carburetor maintains its normal performance after storage.

**Warning:**
Gasoline is flammable and may cause fire and even explosion under certain conditions. Therefore, do not smoke, make fire, or leave any fire source nearby when draining off fuel.

3. Take out the spark plug, pour about 15-20ml of clean engine oil into the cylinder, depress the kick lever repetitively several times to distribute the machine oil all over the engine, and finally refit the spark plug.

**Attention:**
The ignition switch must be set to "off" position when stepping down the kick lever. To protect the ignition system from damage, the spark plug should be inserted in its cap and grounded.

4. Wash the vehicle clean, wipe it dry, and apply an even coat of wax to the painted surface and a coat of antirust oil to the chrome-plated surface.

5. Inflate the tires as required and elevate the vehicle using wooden blocks with the two wheels clear of the ground.

6. Place the vehicle in a shady and cool place free from humidity and direct sunshine, and cover it properly (but not with plastic or other airtight materials). If there is a garage, store it there.

### Adjustment of Throttle Cable

Ensure that the adjusting and lock nuts of the throttle cable work normally.

Check if the throttle twist grip has the required free operating movement.

The required free operating movement: 2-6mm. If the grip cannot be moved freely, turn the adjusting nut to ensure it.

After adjustment, start the engine and check the free operating movement again. Repeat the adjustment if necessary until it is as required.

### Adjustment of Carburetor

The adjusting procedures for idling speed:

1. Support the vehicle with a stand.
2. Adjust the idling speed using the throttle stop screw to 1500±150rpm.

**Caution:**
Do not try to cover up any trouble with other parts of the carburetor by adjusting the idling speed. In case of any abnormality with the carburetor, it must be addressed by a Service Center. Adjustment of idling speed should be made only when the cold engine is warmed up or 10 minutes after the motorcycle is stopped from driving.

### Check-up & Adjustment of Air Valve Gap

Noise will stem from too big a gap in the air valve. However, if there is too small a gap or even no gap at all, closing of the valve will be hindered, which can cause burning of the valve and a drop in output. Therefore, the air valve gap must be checked periodically.

The gap of the air valve should be inspected and adjusted with a cold engine by the following procedures:

1. Remove the caps of the central hole and the top hole (the ignition timing observation hole) in the left crankcase cover.
2. Remove the caps of the two air valves on the cylinder head.
3. Insert the 'T' key into the central hole of the crankcase cover, jam it against the nut of the flying wheel, and then turn the flying wheel clockwise until the engraved 'T' mark on the flying wheel aligns with the engraved line on the top of the crankcase cover.
4. Swing the rocking arm slightly.
    - A loose rocking arm (which indicates the existence of clearance) shows that the piston is in the upper stop position of the compressing stroke, where the valve can be adjusted.
    - A tight rocking arm means that the piston is in the lower stop position of the compressing stroke. In this case, continuously turn the 'T' key clockwise for 360 degrees until the alignment of those engraved marks, where the valve can be adjusted.
5. Afterwards, check the valve gap by inserting a feeler in between the valve adjusting screw and the end of the valve.

The specified air valve gap: **0.06mm** for the intake and exhaust valves, respectively.

### Vehicle Washing

Cleaning the vehicle regularly can slow down the color fading of its body and make it easier to check for any damage and any oil leakage.

**Caution:**
Washing the motorcycle with over-pressurized water may cause damage to some of its components. Therefore, do not jet over-pressurized water directly onto the following parts:

- Wheel hub
- Exhaust pipe
- Fuel tank and lower portion of cushion
- Carburetor
- Head lock and ignition switch
- Meters

1. After pre-wiping, the vehicle should be washed with clean water to remove dirty residues to prevent corrosion. Plastic subassemblies should be cleaned by wiping with cloth or foam soaked in neutral detergent solution.
2. After the cleaned vehicle is air dried, grease the chain and run the engine at idling speed for a few minutes.
3. Prior to driving, carefully check the braking system repeatedly and repair or adjust it if necessary.

### Greasing Procedures for the Driving Chain

1. Shut off the engine.
2. Add some machine oil or chain grease to the driving chain.

**Attention:**
When the rear wheel axle has moved to the back adjusting limit, if excess looseness is caused by wear to the driving chain, please replace it with a new one.

### Brake Checking

1. Pull up the front and rear brakes respectively and check for wear of the brake shoes. If the mark (^) on the brake drum cover aligns with that (^) on the brake cam, it means that the brake shoes are already worn to the limit and need to be replaced.
2. Replacement should be carried out at a designated service center, and it is recommended that parts made by our company are used.

#### Adjustment of Front Brake

1. The front brake lever has a free operating movement of 10-20mm as shown in the figure on the right side.
2. The adjustment shall be carried out by turning the adjusting nut beneath the front hub, clockwise to increase and counterclockwise to decrease the free operating movement.
3. It can also be adjusted by turning the front adjusting nut on the handlebar, clockwise to increase and counterclockwise to decrease the free operating movement.
4. The lock nut has to be tightened after adjustment.

#### Adjustment of Rear Brake

The vehicle should be supported for check by the side stand.

1. The rear brake pedal has a free operating movement of 20-30mm.
2. To make an adjustment, turn the rear adjusting nut clockwise to reduce and counterclockwise to increase the free operating movement of the brake pedal.

### Adjustment of Chain

1. When regulation is needed, loosen the rear axle nut.
2. Turn the chain adjusting nuts on the left and right sides to adjust the tension of the chain and to align the marking of the chain adjustor with the engraved lines in a similar position on both sides.
3. Tighten the lock nut and rear axle nut with a torque of 35-50 Nm.
4. Repetitively check the tension of the chain.
5. When the rear wheel is changed in position and the chain adjusted, the free operating movement of the rear brake pedal will be affected, which should therefore be checked thereafter and also regulated if necessary.
