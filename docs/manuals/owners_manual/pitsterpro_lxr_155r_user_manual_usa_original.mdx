## Fuel

The capacity of the fuel tank is 3.8 L (1.0 US gal). To open the fuel tank cap, pull out the breather hose from the hole in the number plate and turn the tank cap counterclockwise.

Avoid filling the tank in the rain or where heavy dust is blowing so that the fuel does not get contaminated.

![Photo](../../../static/img/33325273f4c63f607833689cd17d190b7d61807334e93ab5e71f997f38e07770.jpg)

**WARNING**: Gasoline is extremely flammable and can be explosive under certain conditions. Always stop the engine and do not smoke. Make sure the area is well ventilated and free from any source of flame or sparks; this includes any appliance with a pilot light. After refueling, make sure the fuel tank cap is closed securely. If gasoline is spilled on the fuel tank, wipe it off.

## Fuel Requirements

**Fuel Type**

Use clean, fresh unleaded gasoline with a minimum Antiknock index of 87. The Antiknock Index is posted on service station pumps in the U.S.A. The octane rating of gasoline is a measure of its resistance to detonation or knocking. The Antiknock Index is an average of the Research Octane Number (RON) and the Motor Octane Number (MON) as shown in the table below.

| Octane Rating Method            | Minimum Rating |
|---------------------------------|----------------|
| (RON + MON) Antiknock index     | 87             |
| Research Octane Number (RON)    | 91             |

**CAUTION**: Different brand of gasoline of a higher octane rating. If this condition is allowed to continue it can lead to severe engine damage. Gasoline quality is important. Fuels of low quality or not meeting standard industry specifications.Fuels Containing Oxygenates

Gasoline frequently contains oxygenates (alcohols and ethers especially in areas of the U.S. and Canada which are required to sell such reformulated fuels as part of a strategy to reduce exhaust emissions.

The types and volume of fuel oxygenates approved for use in unleaded gasoline by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency include a broad range of alcohols and ethers, but only two components have seen any significant level of commercial use.

Gasoline f Alcohol Blends - Gasoline containing up to 10% ethanol alcohol produced from agricultural products such as corn, also known as gasohol is approved for use.

# 12 GENERAL INFORMATION

| CAUTION |
| --- |
| Avoid using blends of unleaded gasoline and methanol (wood alcohol) whenever possible, and never use gasohol containing more than 5% methanol. Fuel system damage and performance problems may result. |

Gasoline/Ether Blends - The most common ether is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). You may use gasoline containing up to 15% MTBE.

# NOTE

Other oxygenates approved for use in unleaded gasoline include TAME up to 16.7% and ETBE up to 17.2%. Fuel containing these oxygenates can also be used in your Pitsterpro.

| CAUTION |
| --- |
| Never use gasoline with an octane rating lower than the minimum specified by Pitsterpro. Never use “gasohol" with more than 10% ethanol, or more than 5% methanol. Gasoline containing methanol must also be blended with co-solvents and corrosion inhibitors. Certain ingredients of gasoline may cause paint fading or damage. Be extra careful not to spill gasoline or gasoline oxygenate blends during refueling. |

# Fuel Tap

The fuel tap has three positions: OFF, ON, and RES reserve. For normal operation, turn the fuel tap lever to the ON position. If the fuel runs out with the tap in the ON position, the last 0.5L (0.13 US gal) of fuel can be used by turning the tap lever to the RES position.

![Fuel Tap](../../../static/img/44ae09fd728e94860235916e69d0c6d4ef44aef0e4a8253a3ed4bd2495b9f471.jpg)

A. Fuel Tap C. OFF Position B. ON Position D. RES Position

Turn the fuel tap lever to the OFF position when the fuel tank is removed for maintenance and adjustments or the motorcycle is stored for a long time.

# NOTE

Since riding distance is limited when on RES, refuel at the earliest opportunity.
- Make certain that the fuel tap is turned to ON (not RES) after filling up the fuel tank.

# WARNING

Practice operating the fuel tap with the motorcycle stopped. To prevent an accident, you should be able to operate the fuel tap while riding without taking your eyes off the road.
Be careful not to touch the hot engine while operating the fuel tap.

# 14 GENERAL INFORMATION

# Engine Stop Switch

The engine stop switch is located on the left side of the handlebar. For ordinary engine stoppage and, if some emergency requires stopping the engine.

## 22 GENERAL INFORMATION

## Break-In

The first one hour that the motorcycle is ridden is designed as the break-in period. If the motorcycle is not used carefully during this period, you may very well end up with a broken down instead of a broken in motorcycle.

Do not start moving or race the engine immediately after starting it, even if the engine is already warm. Run the engine for two or three minutes at idle speed to give the oil a chance to work up into all the engine parts.

Avoid quick acceleration or starting and drive prudently for the first one hour of operation. Let the motorcycle cool completely. The motorcycle is ready for regular operation after this procedure is carried out.

## MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT

The maintenance and adjustments outlined in this chapter must be carried out in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart to keep the vehicle in good running condition. The initial maintenance is vitally important and must not be neglected.

With a basic knowledge of mechanics and the proper use of tools, you should be able to carry out many of the maintenance items described in this chapter. If you lack proper experience or doubt your ability, all adjustments, maintenance, and repair work should be completed by a qualified technician.

To protect the environment in which we all live, Pitsterpro has incorporated emission control systems in compliance with applicable regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board.

# 1. Crankcase Emission Control System

This system eliminates the release of crankcase vapors into the atmosphere, instead, the vapors are routed through an oil separator to the intake side of the engine. While the engine is operating, the vapors are drawn into the combustion chamber, where they are burned along with the fuel and air supplied by the carburetor(s).

# 2. Exhaust Emission Control System

This system reduces the amount of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere by the exhaust of this vehicle. The fuel, ignition, and exhaust systems of this vehicle have been carefully designed and constructed to ensure an efficient engine with low exhaust pollutant levels.

# MAINTENANCE

Proper maintenance is necessary to ensure that your vehicle will continue to have low emission levels. This Owner's Manual contains maintenance operations recommended for your vehicle. Maintenance operations necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable emission standards are noted in the Periodic Maintenance Chart. As the owner of this vehicle, you have the responsibility to make sure that the recommended maintenance is carried out according to the instructions in this Owner's Manual at your own expense.

You should keep a maintenance record for your vehicle. To assist you in keeping this record, we have provided space on pages 70 through 75 of this manual where an authorized Pitster Pro dealer, or someone equally competent, can record the maintenance. You should also retain copies of maintenance work orders, receipts, etc., as verification of this maintenance.

# Warranty

This vehicle is designed, built, and equipped in compliance with applicable regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Resources Board (CARB) at the time of sale. The EPA and CARB require that your vehicle comply with certain emissions regulations during a portion of its useful life and is free from defects in material and workmanship which could cause the vehicle to fail to conform with applicable regulations.

# Spark Plug

![Spark Plug](../../../static/img/a779095f3df45474c4090ba7ac4c510906673dc0d4e62832df8732a29c2e7268.jpg)
A. Gap B. Outer Electrode

The spark plug should be taken out in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart for cleaning, inspection, and resetting of the plug gap. Measure the gap with a wire-type thickness gauge. If incorrect, adjust the gap to the specified value by bending the outer electrode.

# Spark Plug Gap

| NGKC7HS | 0.6-0.7 mm (0.024-0.028 in) |

# MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT33

If the plug is oily or has carbon built up on it, clean it (preferably with a sand-blaster) and then clean off any abrasive particles. The plug may also be cleaned using a high-flash point solvent and a wire brush or other suitable tool. If the spark plug electrodes are corroded, or damaged, or if the insulator is cracked, replace the plug. The standard spark plug is shown in the table below.

# Standard Spark Plug

A. Plug Cap B. Spark Plug

# Valve Clearance

Valve and valve seat wear decreases valve clearance, upsetting valve t

CAUTION
If valve clearance is left unadjusted, wear will eventually cause the valves to remain partly open; which lowers performance, burns the valves and valve seats, and may cause serious engine damage.

Valve clearance for each valve should be checked and adjusted in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart.

Inspection and adjustment should be done only by a competent mechanic following the instructions in the Service Manual.

# Air Filter

Lube your air filter with a Foam Filter Oil before riding. Foam filter oil can be found at a local auto parts store or motorcycle shop. This keeps debris from being sucked into the engine and causing loss of power and engine failure.

We recommend cleaning your air filter after every ride with a foam filter cleaner and then reapplying filter oil as directed on foam filter oil can. Please follow the directions printed on the can of cleaning agent as well as filter oil, misuse may destroy or ruin your air filter.

# Maintenance and Adjustment

## Throttle Grip

The throttle grip controls the throttle valve. If the throttle grip has excessive play due to either cable stretch or maladjustment, it will cause a delay in throttle response, especially at low engine speed. Also, the throttle valve may not open fully at full throttle. On the other hand, if the throttle grip has no play, the throttle will be hard to control, and the idle speed will be erratic. Check the throttle grip play in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart, and adjust the play if necessary.

## Inspection

Check that the throttle grip turns smoothly and there is 2-3 mm (0.08-0.12 in) throttle grip play when lightly turning the throttle grip back and forth.

![Throttle Grip](../../../static/img/0ff182699e616cdd6f0ed7a7849ce5665c7928d1bddbf65269b11025e0d7a07e.jpg "Throttle Grip 2-3mm (0.08-0.12 in)")

If there is improper play, adjust it.

## Throttle Cable Adjustment

Pull the rubber boot off the upper end of the throttle cable. Loosen the locknut on the upper end of the throttle cable and turn the adjuster to obtain the specified play.

![Throttle Cable Adjustment](../../../static/img/972609b9265fc09f4462fc70c9105505d670dcc764e72ab4c5043bd3947305f5.jpg "Dust cover, Adjuster, Locknut")

Tighten the locknut. Reinstall the rubber boot.
- If the free play cannot be set with the adjuster on the upper end of the throttle cable, pull the rubber boot off the top of the carburetor and make the necessary free play adjustment with the adjuster on the lower end of the cable. Then, tighten the locknut and reinstall the rubber boot.

Check if the throttle grip moves smoothly from full open to close, and the throttle closes quickly and completely in all steering positions by the return spring. If not, check the throttle cable routing, grip free play, and cable damage. Then lubricate the throttle cable. With the engine idling, turn the handlebar both ways and check if hand.

# Idle Adjustment

The idle adjustment procedure is essential whenever the idle speed is disturbed.

1. Start the engine and warm it up thoroughly.

   !![Image of idling adjustment](../../../static/img/f82365101a254b30f557c37ca842562873e01c017d4a48e8beaa507070e121fd.jpg)

## Idle Adjusting Screw

To avoid serious burns, never touch a hot engine or exhaust pipe during idle adjustment.

Adjust the idling speed to 1400-100 rpm by turning the idling adjusting screw.

Open and close the throttle a few times to ensure that the idling speed remains consistent. Readjust if necessary. When the engine is idling, turn the handlebar to each side. If the handlebar movement affects the idling speed, the throttle cable may be improperly adjusted or incorrectly routed, or it may be damaged. Make sure to correct any of these conditions before riding.

**WARNING:** Operation with a damaged throttle cable could lead to an unsafe riding condition.

# Drive Chain

The drive chain must be checked, adjusted, and lubricated for safety and to prevent excessive wear. If the chain becomes badly worn or adjusted incorrectly—either too loose or too tight—the chain could jump off the sprockets or break.

**WARNING:** A chain that breaks or jumps off the sprockets could snag on the engine sprocket or lock the rear wheel, severely damaging the motorcycle and causing it to go out of control.

## Chain Slack Inspection

Set the motorcycle up on a stand. Rotate the rear wheel to find the position where the chain is lightest because it wears unevenly, and measure the maximum chain slack as follows:

- Push on the chain midway between the engine sprocket and rear wheel's sprocket.
- The drive chain slack is correct when the chain can be pushed out within 1 to 2 inches from the hollow of the chain guard.

   !![Image of chain slack inspection](../../../static/img/443f5d77ca0598a0b5d0fd691ec147449652745c465e2e09e6d7a224ef2c7edc.jpg)

    A. 1 inch - 2 inches (Chain Guard)
    B. Hollow
    C. Push Up
    D. Push Down

If the drive chain is either too tight or too loose, adjust the slack to ensure it falls within the standard value.

## Drive Chain Slack

It should be set at about 2 inches of total movement, from pushing the chain down against the swing arm and lifting up to a total height of about 2 inches.

## Chain Slack Adjustment

Remove the cotter pin from the torque link nut and loosen the torque link nut.

# Maintenance and Adjustment

If the inspection reveals an unacceptable amount of chain slack, then adjustment is necessary.
# Adjusting Drive Chain

It may be necessary to either tighten or loosen the drive chain. Please adhere to the following guidelines to adjust accordingly:

1. Axle nut
2. Block nut
3. Chain adjuster bolt

![Chain Slack Adjustment](../../../static/img/d98d08fcde9c5be0fc144c238fc6f3ba86bb8841aac964265a697e79332b568d.jpg)

**Procedure:**

1. Loosen axle nut (A).
2. Loosen lock nut B on both sides of the motorcycle.
3. Turn the chain adjuster nuts C on both sides an equal number of turns to increase or decrease chain slack.
4. Tighten lock nuts on both sides of the motorcycle.
5. Recheck chain slack.

# Warning

A worn chain can lead to an accident by coming off the sprockets and hanging up on moving parts. Serious injury or death may occur.

# Drive Chain Maintenance

Checking your drive chain and associated parts is essential for proper maintenance. Please review the following information to ensure compliance with the Maintenance Schedule:

1. It is imperative to replace the chain if it stretches by 1/10 of its original length. The most effective means by which to measure the chain is by examining part of it (20 links).
2. Make sure the chain is tight using the chain adjusters.
3. Then measure 20 links. Take your measurement from the center of the first pin to the center of the 21st pin. If this measurement exceeds the service limit then it's time to replace the chain.

# Diagram of Chain Adjustment

![Diagram of Chain Adjustment](../../../static/img/7a2c11cf1321aeed403e407465e9396958a1367a19dda9613c9fed41081ba273.jpg)

Measure a span of 21 pins
- New Chain: 10.0 inches (254mm)
- Service Limit: 10.2 inches (259mm)

4. Examine the front and rear sprockets as well. If the chain is worn then replace the sprockets as well.
5. Also inspect the roller for wear and replace as needed.
6. Lubricate the chain thoroughly with each service using recommended Chain Lube, SAE 80 or 90 gear oil.

## Drive Chain Removal and Cleaning

![Drive Chain Removal](../../../static/img/21249f89904a7f235180d7f2e6bf883599ddaa5fa0892269bc2219290414f58a.jpg)

**Process:**

1. When the drive chain becomes extremely dirty from muddy or sandy conditions, it should be removed and cleaned to prolong life.
2. Remove the master link retaining clip (A) with pliers. Be sure not to damage the clip. Remove the master link. Remove the drive chain.
3. Thoroughly clean the chain with kerosene. Then allow it to dry.
4. Visually examine the drive chain to inspect for damage. If damaged, replace.
5. Lubricate the drive chain, including the rollers and bushings.
6. Thread the chain over the sprockets. Then connect the ends of the chain with the master link. For ease of assembly, hold the chain ends against adjacent rear sprocket teeth while inserting the master link. Install the master link retaining clip so that the closed end of the retaining clip will face the direction of forward wheel rotation.

![Sprocket Wear Inspection](../../../static/img/4043a703702f8f787c155740e85125a8adeb5017d47b5aed681bf3d2bd96be23.jpg)

Visually inspect the sprocket teeth and replace the sprocket if its teeth are worn or damaged.

## Chain Lubrication

Lubrication of the drive chain is necessary after riding in the rain or mud, or any time the chain appears dry. We recommend using a chain lube from a local motorcycle shop for optimal protection.

## NOTE

Sprocket wear is evaluated in the illustration below.

Apply oil to the side of the rollers so that it will penetrate to the roller and bushings. Wipe off any excess oil.

![Handlebar](../../../static/img/9e79d4bcae37d5e989b6f5fbcb93773607db6ebd5593f5f1dc926c34538c96c2.jpg)

To keep the handlebar properly secured in place, it is necessary to install the handlebar clamps correctly.

Mount the handlebar clamps so that the arrows on the clamp face to the front. Align the gap at the rear with the punch mark on the handlebar.

![Handlebar Clamps](../../../static/img/7e29a82dae78ba425c40a046b974ed45f8ee03c98cbb28eff225510b4d631099.jpg)

Torque it to 25 Nm (2.5 kgf-m, 18 ft-lb), front first then rear. If the handlebar clamps are correctly installed, there will be no gap at the front and an even gap at the rear of the clamps after tightening the bolts.

![Gap](../../../static/img/9c3f8a34a2674e471b7d9e08cf3b1f6d81c6b483d238e843d119b47e97100513.jpg)

# Warning

Maintaining proper brake adjustment is crucial to safe operation of your motorcycle. Improper adjustment may result in brake assembly damage and cause an accident. An accident may cause serious injury or death.

# Rear Brake:

**Rear Brake Pedal Play Inspection**

The brake pedal play should be 20-30mm (0.8-1.2in) when the pedal is pushed down lightly by hand.

![Rear Brake Pedal](../../../static/img/e747a5db82eed125599583db7d69898913b58802715b37bf9ff064fa565eb916.jpg)

- Rear Brake Pedal 20-30mm (0.8-1.2in)

Rotate the wheel to check for brake drag. Operate the pedal a few times to see that it returns to its rest position immediately upon release. Check braking effectiveness. If braking needs to be adjusted, loosening the Allen bolt that holds the special offset hex nut makes moving the pedal up and down to get the right adjustment simple. Be sure not to adjust the pedal too low or it may bottom out on the foot peg mount, limiting braking capability. If the pedal has improper play, adjust it. Be sure to always check your brake fluid before riding. If you need to add fluid, use DOT4 or better fluid.

# Warning

Always maintain proper brake adjustment. If adjustment is small, the brake could drag and overheat. This could damage the brake assembly and possibly lock the wheel, resulting in loss of control.

# MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT

## Steering

The steering should always be kept adjusted so that the handlebar will turn freely but not have excessive play. The steering play must be checked in accordance with the periodic maintenance chart.

### Steering Inspection

To check the steering adjustment, raise the front wheel off the ground using a jack (special tool). Push the handlebar lightly to either side. If the handlebar continues moving under its own momentum, the steering is not too light. Squatting in front of the motorcycle, grasp the lower ends of the front fork at the axle, and push and rock the front fork back and forth as shown. If play is felt, the steering is too loose and needs to be adjusted.

# Spokes and Rims

The spokes on both wheels must all be tightened securely and evenly and not be allowed to loosen. Unevenly tightened or loose spokes will cause the rim to warp, hasten nipple and overall spoke fatigue, and may result in spoke breakage.

![Spoke Wrench](../../../static/img/cd9b785105c5dd0853b2de67c257a7b6d0330541728560a1fe7ce94165df4e45.jpg)

# Rim Runout

Set up a dial gauge on the side of the rim, and rotate the wheel to measure its axial runout. The difference between the highest and lowest readings is the amount of runout.

Set up the dial gauge on the inner circumference of the rim and rotate the wheel to measure its radial runout.

The difference between the highest and lowest dial readings is the amount of runout.

A certain amount of rim warpage or runout can be corrected by recentering the rim, that is, loosening some spokes and tightening others to change the position of certain portions of the rim. If the rim is badly bent, however, it should be replaced.

# NOTE

Where the rim is welded, the rim may show excessive runout. Disregard this when measuring runout.

# Torque of Nuts and Bolts

Location of the Nuts and Bolts

Before the first ride of each day of operation, check the tightness of the nuts and bolts shown below. Check also that all cotter pins are in place and in good condition. We recommend using a quality thread locker to prevent bolts from coming loose over time. This should be done as part of the set up of your new bike before riding.

# Cleaning Your Motorcycle

## General Precautions

Frequent and proper care of your motorcycle will enhance its appearance, optimize overall performance, and extend its useful life. Covering your motorcycle with a high-quality, breathable motorcycle cover will help protect its finish from harmful UV rays, pollutants, and reduce the amounts of dust reaching its surfaces.

- Be sure the engine and exhaust are cool before washing.
- Avoid applying degreaser to seals, brake pads, and tires. Always use non-abrasive wax and cleaner/polisher. Avoid all harsh chemicals, solvents, detergents, and household cleaning products such as ammonia-based window cleaners.
- Gasoline, brake fluid, and coolant will damage the finish of painted and plastic surfaces: wash them off immediately.
- Avoid wire brushes, steel wool, and all other abrasive pads or brushes.
- Use care when washing the plastic parts as they can easily be scratched.
- Avoid using harsh chemicals on your motorcycle.
Using pressure washers water can penetrate seals and electrical components and damage your motorcycle.
Avoid spraying water in delicate areas such as in air intakes, carburetors, brake components, electrical components, muffler outlets, and fuel tank openings.

# Washing Your Motorcycle

Rinse your bike with cold water from a garden hose to remove any loose dirt.
Mix a mild neutral detergent (designed for motorcycles or automobiles) and water in a bucket. Use a soft cloth or sponge to wash your motorcycle. If needed, use a mild degreaser to remove any oil or grease buildup. After washing, rinse your motorcycle thoroughly with clean water to remove any residue (residue from the detergent can damage parts of your motorcycle). Use a soft cloth to dry your motorcycle. As you dry, inspect your motorcycle for chips and scratches. Do not let the water air dry as this can damage the painted surfaces.
Start the engine and let it idle for several minutes. The heat from the engine will help dry moist areas.
Carefully ride your motorcycle at a slow speed and apply the brakes several times. This helps dry the brakes and restores them to normal operating performance. Lubricate the drive chain to prevent rusting.

# NOTE

- After riding in an area where the roads are salted or near the ocean, immediately wash your motorcycle with cold water. Do not use warm water as it accelerates the chemical reaction of the salt. After drying, apply a corrosion protection spray on all metal and chrome surfaces to prevent corrosion.

# MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT

## Painted Surfaces

After washing your motorcycle, coat painted surfaces, both metal and plastic, with a commercially available motorcycle/automotive wax. Wax should be applied once every three months or as conditions require. Avoid surfaces with "satin or flat" finishes. Always use nonabrasive products and apply them according to the instructions on the container.

## Other Plastic Parts

After washing, use a soft cloth to gently dry plastic parts. When dry, treat the non-painted plastic parts with an approved plastic cleaner/polisher product.

CAUTION
Plastic parts may deteriorate and break if they come in contact with chemical substances or household cleaning products such as gasoline, brake fluid, window cleaners, thread-locking agents, or other harsh chemicals. If a plastic part comes in contact with any harsh chemical substance, wash it off immediately with water and a mild neutral detergent, and then inspect for damage. Avoid using abrasive pads or brushes to clean plastic parts, as they will damage the part's finish.

## Chrome and Aluminum

Chrome and uncoated aluminum parts can be treated with a chrome/aluminum polish. Coated aluminum should be washed with a mild neutral detergent and finished with a spray polish. Aluminum wheels, both painted and unpainted, can be cleaned with special non-acid-based wheel spray.

| CAUTION |
| --- |
| Plastic parts may deteriorate and break if they come in contact with chemical substances or household cleaning products such as gasoline, brake fluid, window cleaners, thread-locking agents, or other harsh chemicals. If a plastic part comes in contact with any harsh chemical substance, wash it off immediately with water and a mild neutral detergent, and then inspect for damage. Avoid using abrasive pads or brushes to clean plastic parts, as they will damage the part's finish. |

# Motorcycle Maintenance Guide

## Cleaning

### Bodywork

Use mild soap and water to clean the motorcycle's bodywork. Avoid abrasive cleaners.

### Leather, Vinyl, and Rubber

If your motorcycle has leather accessories, special care must be taken. Use a leather cleaner/treatment to clean and care for leather accessories. Washing leather parts with detergent and water will damage them, shortening their life.

Vinyl parts should be washed with the rest of the motorcycle and then treated with a vinyl treatment.

The sidewalls of tires and other rubber components should be treated with a rubber protectant to help prolong their useful life.

# Warning

Special care must be taken not to get any rubber protectant on the tire's tread surface when treating tires. This may decrease the tire's ability to maintain contact with the road surface, causing the rider to lose control.

## Maintenance and Adjustment

### Lubrication

Lubricate the areas shown in the illustrations of this section with either motor oil or regular grease, in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart and whenever the vehicle has been operated under wet or rainy conditions, especially after using a high-pressure spray washer. Before lubricating a part, clean off any rust with rust remover and wipe off any grease, oil, dirt, or grime.

#### General Lubrication

Apply motor oil to the following pivots:
- Side Stand

![Side Stand](../../../static/img/2b381d45403cf004949e7270e571f031c878570e09539a6e24cb355408ebfe3e.jpg)

- Rear Brake Rod Joints
- Kick Pedal

## Drive Chain Lubrication

Apply grease to the following points:
- Upper end of throttle cable

![Throttle Cable](../../../static/img/d2ed36049e30fd9c6d54ba4a7db4d16f8df753ae6e7a7e2f37808140dd27ee41.jpg)

### Drive Chain Lubrication

Lubrication is also necessary after riding through rain or on wet tracks, or any time that the chain appears dry. A heavy oil such as SAE 90 is preferred to a lighter oil because it will stay on the chain longer and provide better lubrication.

Apply oil to the side of the rollers so that it will penetrate to the rollers and bushings. Wipe off any excess oil.

![Chain Lubrication](../../../static/img/b1b48c960d96ae4d30617f27fc61856b9f318c6b84fe9954acdf5319d587995c.jpg)

## Linkage Maintenance

Linkage suspension requires special maintenance. Be sure to check the bolts and bearings on your new linkage suspension often. Make sure that the bearings are greased properly and are not worn out. Failure to check these things could result in injury.
