## PRE-OPERATION INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE

Before riding for break-in operation, practice, or a race, make sure the engine is in good operating condition. Before using this engine, check the following points.

### ENGINE OIL LEVEL INSPECTION

1. Start the engine, warm it up for several minutes, and then turn off the engine and wait for a few minutes.
2. Place the bike on a level place and hold it upright.
3. Check the oil level through the sight glass. The oil level should be between the upper and the central point of the sight glass.
4. Add oil to the proper level.

**WARNING:** Add oil as necessary when installing the oil cooler.

### CARBURETOR SETTING

The carburetor is extremely sensitive to foreign matter (dirt, sand, water, etc.). During installation, do not allow foreign matter to get into the carburetor. Always handle the carburetor and its components carefully. Even slight scratches, bends, or damage to carburetor parts may prevent the carburetor from functioning correctly. Carefully perform all servicing with the appropriate tools and without applying excessive force. After installing the carburetor, check that the throttle operates correctly and opens and closes smoothly. It is highly recommended that the carburetor setting is performed by an experienced mechanic to obtain the best possible performance.

#### Atmospheric conditions and carburetor settings

| Air Temp. | Humidity | Air Pressure (Altitude) | Mixture | Setting |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------|---------|
| High      | High     | Low (High)              | Richer  | Leaner  |
| Low       | Low      | High (Low)              | Leaner  | Richer  |

The air density (i.e., concentration of oxygen in the air) determines the richness or leanness of the air/fuel mixture. Therefore, refer to the above table for mixture settings.

- Higher temperature expands the air resulting in reduced density.
- Higher humidity reduces the amount of oxygen in the air due to the presence of water vapor. Lower atmospheric pressure (at high altitude) reduces the air density.

Here is the recommended setting information for KEIHIN PWK33 and PE28 carburetors:

| Item             | Recommendation                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Main Jet         | #120-#125 (without UNI Air Filter)         |
| Slow Jet         | #42                                        |
| Throttle Valve   | #6.0                                       |
| Jet Needle       | W956R-1175W (DAYTONA original)             |
|                  | Clip position: In the 3rd groove from the top |
| Air Screw        | 2 return                                   |

For KEIHIN PE28:

| Item             | Recommendation                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Main Jet         | #120-#125 (with UNI Air Filter)            |
| Slow Jet         | #42                                        |
| Throttle Valve   | #2.5                                       |
| Jet Needle       | #69414 / 46JFQ (-2 / Φ 2.505)              |
| Air Screw        | Clip position: In the 3rd groove from the top 2 return |

### IGNITION TIMING SELECTION

ANIMA 150F ENGINE comes with an ignition timing selectable CDI unit.

#### Notes

- Reduce Timing gives more torque at low-middle RPM levels.
- Advance Timing gives more torque at higher RPM levels than Reduce Timing.

Example (How to select)
* To select Timing (2), connect Yellow and Green wires.

### REV LIMITER SELECTION

ANIMA 150F ENGINE comes with a rev limiter selectable CDI unit.

Example (How to select)
* To select Rev Limiter (3) - 12,900 rpm, connect Blue and Green wires.

### ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL

**WARNING:** Engine oil temperature is to be strictly controlled at 90 degrees Celsius (194 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. Serious damage will occur if engine oil temperature exceeds the limit. It is solely the customer’s responsibility to control the engine oil temperature. Any failures caused by overheating are NOT considered defects of the products. It is highly recommended to use a HIGH-EFFICIENT OIL COOLER and OIL TEMPERATURE GAUGE to protect the engine. Note that engine oil temperature can still exceed 90 degrees Celsius or 194 degrees Fahrenheit even with the recommended OIL COOLER. Thus, customers need to control the oil temperature very carefully.
