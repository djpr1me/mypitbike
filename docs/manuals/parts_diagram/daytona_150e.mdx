## PRE-OPERATION INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE

Before riding for break-in operation, practice, or a race, make sure the engine is in good operating condition. Before using this engine, check the following points.

### ENGINE OIL LEVEL INSPECTION

1. Start the engine, warm it up for several minutes, and then turn off the engine and wait for a few minutes.
2. Place the bike on a level place and hold it upright.
3. Check the oil level through the sight glass. The oil level should be between the upper and the red-colored central point of the sight glass.
4. Add oil to the proper level.

### CARBURETOR SETTING

The carburetor is extremely sensitive to foreign matter (dirt, sand, water, etc.). During installation, do not allow foreign matter to get into the carburetor. Always handle the carburetor and its components carefully. Even slight scratches, bends, or damage to carburetor parts may prevent the carburetor from functioning correctly. Carefully perform all servicing with the appropriate tools and without applying excessive force. After installing the carburetor, check that the throttle operates correctly and opens and closes smoothly. It is highly recommended that the carburetor setting is performed by an experienced mechanic to obtain the best possible performance.

#### Atmospheric conditions and carburetor settings

| Air Temp. | Humidity | Air Pressure (Altitude) | Mixture | Setting |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------|---------|
| High      | High     | Low (High)              | Richer  | Leaner  |
| Low       | Low      | High (Low)              | Leaner  | Richer  |

The air density (i.e., concentration of oxygen in the air) determines the richness or leanness of the air/fuel mixture. Therefore, refer to the above table for mixture settings.

- Higher temperature expands the air with its resultant reduced density.
- Higher humidity reduces the amount of oxygen in the air due to water vapor. Lower atmospheric pressure (at a high altitude) reduces the density of the air.

### EFFECTS OF THE SETTING PARTS ON THE THROTTLE VALVE OPENING

1. Slow Jet / Pilot Screw
2. Throttle valve cutaway
3. Jet Needle / Needle Jet
4. Main Jet

Here is the recommended setting information for KEIHIN PE28 carburetor:

| Tested Conditions  |                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Carburetor         | KEIHIN PE28           |
| Air Temperature    | 20 degrees Celsius    |
| Humidity           | 50%                   |
| Atmospheric Pressure | 1000 hPa            |

| Item          | Recommendation                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Main Jet      | #122-#125 (with AIR FILTER) / #130-#132 (without Air Filter) |
| Slow Jet      | #38 (STD)                                 |
| Throttle Valve| #3.0                                      |
| Jet Needle    | #JFN (STD) Clip position: In the 1st groove from the top |
| Air Screw     | 1 + 1/2 return                            |

### IGNITION TIMING SELECTION

DAYTONA 150E ENGINE comes with an ignition timing selectable CDI unit.

#### Notes

- Timing (1) gives more torque at low-middle RPM levels.
- Timing (2) gives more torque at higher RPM levels than Timing (1).

Example (How to select)
* To select Timing (2), connect White and Green wires.

### ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE CONTROL

#### WARNING

Engine oil temperature is to be strictly controlled at 90 degrees Celsius (194 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower. Serious damage will occur in the engine if engine oil temperature exceeds 90 degrees Celsius or 194 degrees Fahrenheit. It is solely the customer’s responsibility to control the engine oil temperature. Any failures caused by overheating are NOT considered as defects of the products. It is highly recommended to use a HIGH-EFFICIENT OIL COOLER and OIL TEMPERATURE GAUGE to protect the engine.

The above OIL COOLER is just a recommendation. Engine oil temperature can be heated up over 90 degrees Celsius or 194 degrees Fahrenheit, even if the recommended OIL COOLER is used. Again, customers need to control the oil temperature very carefully.

## OPTIONAL PARTS

### OIL COOLER

The following oil coolers are available from Daytona, but the mount bracket must be made by the customer to fit on their bike. The kit components are shown in the photo below.

- Daytona Part# 61785
- Daytona Part# 62759

7-Core Oil Cooler Kit
10-Core Oil Cooler Kit (The same kit components as #61785.)

### OIL TEMPERATURE GAUGE & FITTING

The following temp. gauge and fitting are available from Daytona. The temp. gauge (#47101) can be used with the Daytona oil cooler (#61785) by using the Daytona sensor fitting (#43350).

- Daytona Part# 47101
- Daytona Part# 43350

Temp. gauge & sensor, 0-150 degrees Celsius PT1/8 (Tapered Thread)-Sensor fitting
Sensor fitting for PT1/8 (Tapered Thread) sensor designed for 8mm inner diameter oil hoses.
