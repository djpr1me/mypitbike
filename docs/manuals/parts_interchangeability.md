# CRF50 parts interchangeability

Many parts designed for 50cc pit bikes are compatible with the Honda CRF50, and vice versa. To ensure compatibility, the frame of your motorcycle should closely resemble that of a CRF50.

Here is a list of interchangeable parts:

- Fuel Tank
- Seat
- All Plastics
- Engine

When considering parts swaps or upgrades, always compare with the specific models and consult respective manuals to ensure proper fit and function.
