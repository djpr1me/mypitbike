# Thumpstar Service Manual

## IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE

**WARNING:** Indicates a strong possibility of severe personal injury or death if instructions are not followed.
**CAUTION:** Indicates a possibility of equipment damage if instructions are not followed.
**NOTE:** Gives helpful information.

Detailed descriptions of standard workshop procedures, safety principles, and service operations are not included. It is important to note that this manual contains some warnings and cautions against some specific service methods which could cause PERSONAL INJURY to service personnel or could damage a vehicle or render it unsafe. Please understand that those warnings could not cover all conceivable ways in which service whether or not recommended by manufacturer might be done, or of the possibly hazardous consequences of each conceivable way, nor could a manufacturer investigate all such ways. Anyone using service procedures or tools, whether or not recommended by the manufacturer, must satisfy himself thoroughly that neither personal safety nor vehicle safety will be jeopardized by the service methods or tools selected.

## HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

This service manual describes the service procedures for the Thumpstar Off Road Range.

Follow the Maintenance Schedule (Section 3) recommendations to ensure that the vehicle is in peak operation condition and the emission levels are within the standards set by the California Air Resources Board.

Performing the first scheduled maintenance is very important. It compensates for the initial wear that occurs during the break-in period.

Sections 1 and 3 apply to the whole motorcycle. Section 2 illustrates what may be required to perform service described in the following sections. Sections 4 through 14 describe parts of the motorcycle, grouped according to location.

Find the section you want on this page, then turn to the table of contents on the first page of the section.

Most sections have an assembly or system illustration, service information, and troubleshooting for the section.

The subsequent pages give detailed procedures. If you don't know the source of the trouble, go to section 16, troubleshooting.

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

## GENERAL SAFETY
- CARBON MONOXIDE
  If the engine must be running to do some work, make sure the area is well ventilated. Never run the engine in an enclosed area.

## WARNING
The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that can cause loss of consciousness.

Run the engine in an open area or with an exhaust evacuation system in an enclosed area.

## GASOLINE

Work in a well-ventilated area. Keep cigarettes, flames or sparks away from the work area or where gasoline is stored.

## WARNING

Gasoline is extremely flammable and is explosive under certain conditions. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

## HOT COMPONENTS

## WARNING

Engine and exhaust system parts become very hot and remain hot for some time after the engine is run. Wear insulated gloves or wait until the engine and exhaust system have cooled before handling these parts.

USED ENGINE OIL

## WARNING

Used engine oil may cause skin cancer if repeatedly left in contact with the skin for prolonged periods. Although this is unlikely unless you handle used oil on a daily basis, it is still advisable to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water as soon as possible after handling used oil. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.

1. Use genuine Manufacturer's recommended parts and lubricants or their equivalent. Parts that do not meet Manufacturer's design specifications may cause damage to the motorcycle.
2. Use the special tools designed for this product to avoid damage and incorrect assembly.
3. Use only metric tools when servicing the motorcycle. Metric bolts, nuts, and screws.
4. Install new gaskets, O-ring, cotter pins, and lock plates when reassembling.
5. When tightening bolts or nuts, begin with the larger diameter or inner bolt first. Then tighten to the specified torque diagonally in incremental steps unless a particular sequence is specified.
6. Clean parts in cleaning solvent upon disassembly. Lubricate any sliding surfaces before reassembly.
7. After reassembly, check all parts for proper installation and operation.
8. Route all electrical wires as shown on pages 1-14 through 1-16, Cable and Harness Routing.

# Emission Control Systems

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) requires manufacturers to certify that their motorcycles comply with applicable exhaust emissions standards during their useful life when operated and maintained according to the instructions provided.

# Source of Emissions

Combustion process produces carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Controlling hydrocarbon emissions is very important since they react under certain conditions to form photochemical smog when subjected to sunlight. Carbon monoxide does not react in the same manner, but it is toxic. Manufacturer Motor Co. Ltd utilises lean carburettor settings along with other systems to reducing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.

# Exhaust Emission Control System

The exhaust emission control system comprises a lean carburettor setting, with no adjustments to be made except the idle speed adjustment with the throttle stop screw. This emission control system is distinct from the crankcase emission control system.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Engine top-end problems usually affect engine performance. These problems can be diagnosed by a compression gauge or by tracing engine noises to the top-end with a sounding rod stethoscope.
If the performance is poor at low speeds, check for white smoke in the crankcase breather tube. If the tube is smoky check for a seized piston ring (Section 8).

## Compression too low, hard starting or poor performance at low speed

### Valves

1. Incorrect valve clearance
2. Burned or bent valve
3. Incorrect valve timing
4. Broken valve spring
5. Uneven valve seating

### Cylinder head

- Leaking or damaged head gasket
- Warped or cracked cylinder head
- Worn cylinder, piston or piston rings (section 8)

## Compression too high, overheating or knocking

Excessive carbon build-up on piston crown or on combustion chamber

## Excessive noise

### Cylinder head

- Incorrect valve clearance
- Sticking valve or broken valve spring
- Damaged or worn camshaft
- Loose or worn cam chain

# VALVE SEAT INSPECTION/REFACING

![Valve Seat Inspection/Refacing](../../../static/img/8a7f0436899f11477c7ea1a9a53d3e2179c1c28a1ac4d4f543d3207a0f38e3d2.jpg)

Clean the intake and exhaust valves thoroughly to remove carbon deposits.
Apply a light coating of Prussian Blue to the valve seats. Lap the valves and seats using a rubber hose or other hand-lapping tool. Remove and inspect the valves.
CAUTION: The valves cannot be ground. If a valve face is burned or badly worn, or if it contacts the seat unevenly, replace the valve.

Inspect the width of each valve seat.
STANDARD: 1.0 - 1.3 mm (0.04 - 0.05 in)
SERVICE LIMIT: 2.0 mm (0.08 in)

If the seat is too wide, too narrow, or has low spots, the seat must be ground.

# VALVE SEAT REFACING

Valve seat cutters/grinders equivalent valve seat refacing equipment are recommended to correct worn valve seats.

NOTE: Follow the refacing manufacturer's operation instructions.

Use a 45-degree cutter to remove any roughness or irregularities from the seat. Reface the seat with a 45-degree cutter whenever a valve guide is replaced.

![Valve Seat Cutter 45-degree](../../../static/img/3b70f0a2f15e612060761dc6bd3b9159dadae094dea0c9a6d302251b25224780.jpg)

Use a 32-degree (IN:30) cutter to remove the top 1/4 of the existing valve seat material.

# CYLINDER HEAD/VALVES

Use a 60-degree cutter to remove the bottom 1/4 of the old seat. Remove the cutter and inspect the area you have refaced.
Install a 45-degree finish cutter and cut the seat to the proper width. Make sure that all pitting and irregularities are removed. Refinish if necessary.

# Service Information

# General

# Warning

When the engine must be running to do some work, ensure the area is well-ventilated. Never run the engine in an enclosed area. The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that may cause unconsciousness and potentially lead to death. Run the engine in an open area or use an exhaust evacuation system in an enclosed area.

When servicing the ignition system, always follow the steps in the troubleshooting sequence.On page 14-3. The CDI ignition system uses an electrically controlled ignition timing system. No adjustments can be made to the ignition timing.

The ICM may be damaged if dropped. Also if the connector is disconnected when current is flowing, the excessive voltage may damage the module.

A faulty ignition system is often related to poor connections. Check those connections before proceeding. Use a spark plug of the correct heat range. Using a spark plug with an incorrect heat range can damage the engine. For alternator and ignition pulse generator removal and installation

When the engine must be running to do some work, make sure the area is well-ventilated. Never run the engine in an enclosed area. The exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide gas that may cause loss of consciousness and lead to death. Run the engine in an open area or with an exhaust evacuation system in an enclosed area.

1. When servicing the ignition system, always follow the steps in the troubleshooting sequence on page 14-3.
The CDI ignition system uses an electrically controlled ignition timing system. No adjustments can be made to the ignition timing.
- The CDI may be damaged if dropped. Also, if the connection has been disrupted, it may lead to a malfunction.If a conductor is disconnected when current is flowing, the excessive voltage may damage the module.
A faulty ignition system is often related to poor connections. Check those connections before proceeding.
Use a spark plug of the correct heat range. Using a spark plug with an incorrect heat range can damage the engine. For alternator and ignition pulse generator removal and installation, see section 10.
