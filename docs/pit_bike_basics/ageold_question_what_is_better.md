# Age-old question what is better?

Rather than delving into lengthy discourses about what a pit bike is and extolling its virtues—since numerous articles already abound online—I encourage taking the time to investigate. Reflecting on those article authors conjures an image of a sales consultant with a slick smile, whose aim isn't to elucidate the true nature of pit bikes, but rather to exalt them as the ultimate form of transportation that everyone must acquire. But I digress; that's not our focus today. In this article, I intend to clarify the intricacies of choosing a pit bike, encompassing various brands and sellers.

So, let's begin. Prospective pit bike buyers generally fall into distinct categories. Firstly, those who have never owned a motorcycle, seeking a pit bike as their first and only ride. Why a pit bike? Because it is the most affordable option. Opting for a scooter at a similar cost isn't considered "cool." "I am a biker, not just a scooter rider," they might claim. Honestly, it's about the budget. This group predominantly consists of young individuals, often students, who have saved up a certain amount and are eager to spend it entirely on their first pit bike, overlooking proper gear. "I'll ride carefully," they say until after their first ankle fracture, they hobble on crutches to buy proper motorcycle boots with their parents' money.

The second group comprises somewhat experienced riders who purchase a pit bike as a tool for leisure activities, such as off-roading or simple joyrides. For them, everything is more straightforward due to their experience, financial stability, and access to transport.

The third group consists of those planning to engage in pit biking professionally. Unfortunately, such enthusiasts are rare.

What should you consider when you firmly decide to purchase a pit bike? Budget? Height? Weight? Not at all! First, determine the purpose of buying a pit bike. Many times, I've noticed that when people seek advice in groups regarding pit bike choice, they ask their favorite question, "WHICH IS BETTER?" These questions usually involve comparisons between models of varying price categories, engine sizes, wheel sizes, and tire types—rarely mentioning their intended use for the pit bike. It seems unreasonable, yet they expect precise answers while comparing apples and oranges. Of course, there are "experts" who claim to have a definitive answer, typically around 14-15 years old, and coincidentally, they asked the same question in the same group just the day before.

Let's try to elucidate simply which pit bike suits various needs and why.

### 1) Off-Road Trail and Rough Terrain Riding

For this, a pit bike with a 125cc engine and 17-14 wheels is most appropriate. "Why 125 when a 160 is much more powerful and BETTER," the armchair experts might ask. I'll explain: A 125cc engine is more suited for low-end torque, making it a joy for forest trails and rough terrain. A 160cc (especially the ZS160) excels only in the high rev range, lacking low-end power. The 140cc engine strikes a balance and versatility for such tasks.

Regarding the wheels, I’ll clarify its significance, as it's a subject that often incites heated debates. Wheels 14-12 provide dynamic performance but have noticeably less off-road capability compared to larger wheels. Wheels 17-14 offer superior off-road capability but less agility. While the dynamic performance of 17-14 wheels can be enhanced with properly selected sprockets, conceding speed, the off-road capability of 14-12 wheels cannot be improved without switching to 17-14. Novices often pose the question, "WHICH IS BETTER?" in relation to wheel size, met by someone staunchly claiming, "14-12 is better because 17-14 doesn’t qualify as a pit bike!" Well, technically correct; the largest permissible wheel size by regulation is 14-12, beyond which participation in competitions is not allowed. But one wonders why it matters when the owner isn't competing! If 17-14 performs significantly better off-road, why should one respect regulations at his expense?

### 2) Leisure Rides on Light Trails

In this context, any engine size and wheel setup, like 12-14 or smaller, can suffice. Why not 17-14? Well, when not needing off-road capability much, why opt for it when 14-12 offers a more enjoyable ride?

### 3) Urban Riding

Any engine size is viable, yet here I’d recommend 160cc or greater for obvious reasons. Wheel options could be 12-12 or 14-14, although some enthusiasts mount road tires on 17-14 setups—props to them.

### 4) Motocross Tracks

Here it gets serious. A basic, cheap pit bike won’t suffice. You will need one with a robust frame, triple clamps, handlebars, ideally progression suspension, excellent long-travel suspension (DNM, Fastace, Marzocchi, Volt), and reinforced spokes, hubs, and rims. Simply visit a renowned manufacturer's website and select a top-tier model.

### 5) Stunt Riding

Initially, fully ready stunt pit bikes are rare. You will nonetheless need to purchase additional expensive tuning parts. A compulsory grab rail, rear brake lever, and sturdy handlebars. For novices, buying a pre-prepared used stunt pit bike is easier. The most suitable engine for stunting is the 125cc, offering smoother transition compared to its bigger siblings. Remember: larger displacement doesn’t always equal better! Of course, 140cc and 160cc engines are fine for stunts, but I recommend what’s most convenient for a beginner.

Having clarified potential purposes and configurations, you now at least understand what you need to purchase instead of merely asking, "Recommend a decent pit bike." 

Now, let’s address the second critical factor—budget. Frankly, we're excluding non-Chinese pit bikes like Buccimoto, BBR, and the like since they represent less than 1% of purchases. An article I've appreciated categorizes pit bikes on our market into three to four tiers based on price and therefore quality.

From experience, reviews, and numerous testimonials, I can say if you're planning serious pit biking, but your budget is under 40k-55k, reconsider. Should you really buy a cheap pit bike? The rationale for purchasing dissipates past a certain "quality threshold." Why squander money on a cheap, subpar pit bike that will collapse under strain? Believe me, the urge to push the limits will come, sooner or later.

A novice, utterly naive regarding pit bikes, with say, 40k-45k at hand, will browse the internet for options fitting his budget. So, which model captures his attention? Indeed, the Irbis TTR 125. It resembles a full-sized motorcycle with big wheels and headlights, all at an amusingly low price! At this stage, anyone would be thrilled. Don't pretend you weren't tempted by the Irbis while first exploring pit bikes. Every newbie does.

No, for those using a pit bike solely for beer runs or the occasional weekend garden cruise, the Irbis is perfect—it's built for that purpose. The greatest uproar comes from those expecting serious off-roading performance from an Irbis (or similar class bikes) and then flooding groups with repair queries. Perhaps I'm seen as a fierce critic of Irbis, but the astute will realize this applies to all cheap pit bikes, with Irbis being the most well-known example.

Understand this: you get what you pay for! Inevitably, forums and groups feature "very wise people" who boast about Irbis, Motoland, etc., being exceptional motorcycles for their price, often because they own them and haven’t experienced breakdowns. Specially for them, here's something I should have mentioned upfront—Irbis (and all its budget counterparts) doesn’t have to break down for every owner; CHINA IS A LOTTERY!!! Under equivalent operating conditions, one rider may face a breakdown while another doesn’t. Why is Irbis deemed poor then? Statistically, most owners eventually experience breakdowns. That's the secret.

There’s an even wittier group of owners—convinced all problems stem from incompetence and that motorcycles require CARE. With proper stewardship, even the least expensive model will endure as long as desired. Isn’t it adorable? The crux of the issue apparently lies in care—what a lovely word, CARE—it sounds as though we’re discussing a companion rather than a motorcycle. These naive fools are unaware that daily caring by oil changes, tightening bolts, and gentle wiping won't alter the initial quality of the components—specifically, the quality of cheap metal, somewhere between clay and dung.

This is to emphasize thinking deeply before buying a cheap pit bike.

So, which pit bike should you choose? We’ve sorted out parameters and budget; it's time to examine brands, right? Which is better? Surely one must be superior, right? Such is the simplistic logic of novices when asking "which is better." Let's explore why.

Why is Chinese-made pit bike quality so subpar? The issue is not the supposedly inferior craftsmanship of the Chinese compared to other nations—it's production cost. CHINA PRODUCES TO THE EXACT EXTENT IT'S PAID. This undeniable truth underpins the quality debate. The quality of any pit bike correlates directly with its price, which is why brands offer extensive model ranges, allowing comparisons not based on brands but on specific models.

It's only fair to say that no one has compared pit bikes from different brands under identical conditions and operational time frames. Even if someone considered such an undertaking, they'd be hindered by the "CHINA IS A LOTTERY" rule. So, the question "WHICH IS BETTER?" lacks a precise and unequivocal answer. Judgments can only base themselves on components and owner reviews, yet opinions will always vary. We are, of course, referring to the evaluations of genuinely knowledgeable individuals, not youthful exuberance, where their pit bike is always superior. Indeed, such youthful audience comprises 90% of participants in pit bike groups and 99% of those voting in polls.

Should we continue pondering the meaning behind the question "WHICH IS BETTER?"?

In closing, I’d advise newcomers to diligently research forums, articles, reviews, and brief owner feedback. It's beneficial to visit several stores (which will be the focus of the next article:) Far more productive than perpetuating endless polls and votes in hopes someone else will choose your pit bike.
