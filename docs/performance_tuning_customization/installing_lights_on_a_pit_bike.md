# Installing lights on a pit bike

I decided to install lighting on my Geon X Pit 150 Pro 2014. After spending an hour or two browsing forums on the subject, I gathered my thoughts and headed to the garage to remove the plastic to access the wiring. Upon removing the plastic, I discovered that seven wires were coming from the generator, three of which were capped off. I only needed the two yellow wires, which were connected to each other but not grounded (though there is a possibility they could be connected to each other and grounded as well).

In the store, I purchased a four-contact voltage regulator for a scooter for 85 UAH and a fog light for 50 UAH. I connected the two yellow wires from the generator to the voltage regulator, and also routed the ground and positive to the headlight. I installed a switch before the voltage regulator (one for two wires) and secured it to the frame near the handlebars. The voltage regulator was mounted on the fuel tank bracket near the radiator, and the ground was attached to the radiator's frame mount. The headlight was fixed above the number plate. 

After assembling and starting the bike, everything worked perfectly, and the light was sufficiently bright :) I only forgot to install a fuse for the headlight, but that's an easy fix!
