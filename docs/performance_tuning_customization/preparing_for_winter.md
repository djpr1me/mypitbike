# Preparing for winter

The winter season has arrived, and I wish to extend my congratulations to all who will continue riding as if it were summer, with maximum grip and enjoyment! For us, this winter season of 2013 is planned to be as comfortable as possible, which means that first and foremost, we must **proactively** ensure we have warm clothing and prepare our bikes for the weather conditions. Dressing warmly and comfortably is not particularly challenging, but preparing the pit bike is a task. Let's begin:

1. Install a filter box (to protect the air filter from snow and moisture) _no impregnation required_
2. Change the oil (we use Motul 5100 10W40)
3. **The most intriguing part** - studding the tires, the process is as follows: Use a dowel nail (ask for a dowel nail for a gun in the store) 4.5mm*30 depending on the height of the studs and knobs, M5 nut, M6 washer inside, the original from the dowel outside. The installation process is envisioned as follows: drill a hole vertically in the center of the knob, sharpen the dowel head to make it smooth, insert the dowel into the hole - after removing the original washer and putting on the M6 washer, place the original washer on the dowel, press the nut, then weld the dowel to the nut - done. Don't forget about the protective tape for the tube - usually, a canvas sleeve is used (an old, unnecessary tube can also be used).
