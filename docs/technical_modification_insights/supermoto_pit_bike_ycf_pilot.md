# Supermoto pit bike ycf pilot

The French from YCF never cease to delight. For their personal needs, they have constructed a mini motard project based on the Pilot F150 frame. The swingarm was taken from the Factory SP III model, crafted from aluminum, measuring 420mm in length. The rear shock absorber is an Elka V1. The engine is a two-valve YX 150 with an exhaust orientation similar to the KLX. The engine is fueled by an authentic Japanese Mikuni VM24 carburetor with a Twin Air filter. The exhaust features a Scalvini pipe. The fork triple clamps are reinforced from the SP III model, and the handlebars are YCF mid-size. Braking is handled by Formula radial calipers. For cornering, shortened footpegs have been installed. This technical marvel is completed with a bright, eye-catching design!
