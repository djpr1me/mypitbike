# My brief review of the kxd 608

## My Experience with the 124 cc Pit Bike

I acquired this steed in early July.

- **Engine Capacity:** 124 cc
- **Fuel Tank:** 5 liters
- **Load Capacity:** Up to 90 kg (though assured by the store it could handle 120 kg)
- **Speed:** Up to 90 km/h (promised 110-120 km/h)
- **Wheels:** 14/17 inches
- **Weight:** Approximately 70 kg

Having ridden it for two months now, I can say it has generally pleased me. Not overwhelmingly impressive, as some parts broke or got lost, but it justifies its cost.

### Let's Start with the Drawbacks:

- The chain lock was the first to fail, popping out on sand (it kept happening, especially when the bike was laid on its side).
- After 5 hours of riding, the threads on the chain tensioners stripped (solved by installing long nuts).
- Approximately after 10 hours of riding, the rear wheel bearings failed.
- The plastic chain guard was worn down to almost nothing by the footpeg.
- The seat was mounted on a flimsy bracket, causing the plastic to quickly deform.
- Tighten the bolts a bit too much, and the threads are gone.
- The chain tensioner quickly stretches and starts to make noise.
- The fuel tank vent hose is constantly getting lost.

### On a Positive Note:

I mostly rode on sand, mud, peat, and waterâ€”no issues, just had to clean the air filter regularly.

It tears through the ground in both first and fourth gear.

![Uphill capability](../../static/img/01355f.jpg)

It climbs any hill.

![Gearbox performance](../../static/img/042af4.jpg)

The gearbox operates flawlessly, without jerks, jolts, or gear slips.

![Running smoothly](../../static/img/8b5bfd.jpg)

I ran the first three tanks in break-in mode.

![Fuel & oil usage](../../static/img/1c5385.jpg)

I use 92-95 octane gasoline and 5w-40 oil.

And I've ordered some goodies for the fall.
