# Pit bikes by mikilon

What do we know about Mikilon pit bikes? Not as much as we would like. Some praise them for their reliability and quality, while others are deterred by the name and country of origin. Let's first explore who manufactures them and what models are available in the market. **Zhe Jiang ChaoZhong Industrial Co., LTD** was established on January 8, 1997, as a subsidiary of the **Superman Group**. Initially, they focused on producing small household appliances and trading in electrical tools. After five years of development, the company gained confidence in the market and amassed capital for further growth.

#### 1. Commencement of Pit Bike and ATV Production in 2002

Following China's accession to the WTO in 2001, the company conducted market research and decided to start developing pit bikes and ATVs in 2002. **ChaoZhong Group** invested **5 million USD**, leading to the construction of one of the largest pit bike manufacturing plants. Existing workshops were also upgraded, and modern equipment was installed. Simultaneously, the company spared no expense in attracting top engineers and installing the latest computerized equipment for product design and testing. Research in development, testing, and modification yielded fruitful results, enabling the company to meet customer demands.

#### 2. Continued Growth in 2008

In 2008, the global economic crisis swept across the world. The company seized the opportunity to alter its development model and implement structural transformations to maintain stable and relatively rapid growth. For instance, ERP systems *(Enterprise Resource Planning)* were introduced for warehouses, three-dimensional automated design systems for the research and development department, and an operational management system. Combined with modern technologies, productivity, quality, and production management significantly improved.

#### 3. Concept and Products

Thanks to modern management systems and superior quality, the company achieved international quality certification **ISO9001** and obtained the mandatory certificate in China for motorcycle and ATV production. Additionally, the company received the CE marking, indicating compliance with essential EU requirements. **Mikilon** products have gained recognition from customers worldwide due to their modern design, excellent quality, and competitive pricing. The company's core values include social responsibility *(participation in social programs, charity, etc.)*, innovation, and customer satisfaction. These are crucial elements of the company's business, enabling continuous development of high-quality products and excellent customer service. The company strives to evolve and provide customers with safe, efficient, and modern products. **Mikilon Motor** has experienced a surge in sales and production volumes. Currently, the company can annually produce **up to 50,000 units** (motorcycles, pit bikes, ATVs) ranging from **110 to 250 cc**. The primary market includes **Europe, North and South America, Australia, Asia, Africa**, and more. Following the motto "persistent pursuit of quality, quality achieves the future," **Mikilon** employees sincerely hope to collaborate with partners worldwide to create a shared glorious future.

Plus, successful certification and standard compliance. Now, let's take a look at the company's range of pit bike models.
