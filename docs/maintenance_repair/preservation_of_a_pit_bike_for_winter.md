# Preservation of a pit bike for winter

The portal's administration has succumbed to the fierce cold and left their pit bikes until warmer days. Today, we shall discuss the proper way to prepare a pit bike for winter storage. There are countless articles on the internet, and typically, each offers advice on coating and pouring various special compounds into different parts of the motorcycle, with a total cost exceeding 9000. We will not consider such costly methods, as the pit bike is an unpretentious machine that, however, requires some attention. ![Winterizing a pit bike](http://mypitbike.ru/uploads/images/00/00/04/2012/12/25/da9c37.jpg "Winterizing a pit bike") So, what might we need:

- Phillips screwdriver
- Can of WD-40
- Can of silicone lubricant
- Chain lubricant

The most crucial aspect of storage is thoroughly washing the pit bike before preservation. If you can't do it yourself, take it to a car wash and let them blast away all the dirt, even from the most inaccessible places, like the hub, under the fenders, the engine fins, everywhere. After the pit bike dries, ideally, you should apply polish or wax for the plastic, but we won't do that; we'll simply wipe it dry to ensure no moisture remains. ![Winter storage of a pit bike](http://mypitbike.ru/uploads/images/00/00/04/2012/12/25/bc7800.jpg "Winter storage of a pit bike") Everything will then depend on the storage location. If it's an **unheated garage**, the preparation will be more cumbersome, requiring:

1. Drain all the gasoline from the carburetor by unscrewing the bolt at the bottom, and close the fuel tap
2. Coat all chrome metal, fork legs, etc., with WD-40
3. Cover all rubber hoses, seals, and bushings with silicone lubricant to prevent the rubber from hardening and cracking due to the cold
4. Generously lubricate the chain with special grease
5. If there is a battery, remove it and store it in a warm place
6. Plug the exhaust pipe, preferably with something polyethylene that doesn't allow moisture through. This is to prevent condensation from entering.
7. Cover the air filter with a bag for the same purpose, to keep moisture out
8. Place the moped on a stool to lift the wheels and cover it with a tarp

*Optionally:*

- It is recommended to fill the tank with gasoline of a higher octane rating than usual
- Deflate the tire pressure by half
- Using a syringe, drip a little oil into the cylinder through the spark plug hole, then screw the spark plug back in

1. Wash the pit bike, dry it, and wipe it dry
2. Generously lubricate the chain
3. Close the fuel tap, drain the remaining gasoline from the carburetor (it will evaporate anyway)
4. Find a suitable stool and place your pit bike on it
5. Initially, it will emit a slight odor from the exhaust pipe; if this bothers you, you can twist a piece of newspaper and plug the muffler

Then, feel free to use it as an interior design solution in the hallway, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom... ;)
