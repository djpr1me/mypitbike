# Break-in of a pit bike

The most crucial step after purchasing and assembling a pit bike is its break-in process. Special attention should be paid to the engine, as the term "break-in" specifically pertains to it. The reason is that the engine contains numerous frictional components, and during the initial hours of operation, these parts wear into each other, leaving behind metal shavings that settle in the oil. Therefore, it is recommended not to overburden the engine and to change the oil frequently to remove these metal shavings until the parts have properly settled. In the first 35 engine hours, it is vital to monitor the engine closely, avoiding overloading and over-revving it. Regularly check the oil level using the dipstick. Place the pit bike on a level surface, unscrew the filler cap-dipstick, wipe it with a cloth to remove oil, then reinsert it without screwing it in, remove the dipstick, and check the oil level. If the level is somewhere in the middle of the dipstick's ribbed surface, the oil is sufficient; if it is lower, add more oil. Avoid mixing different types, viscosities, and brands of oil. If the engine is hot, wait a few minutes for it to cool down. In the first 35 engine hours, never allow the engine to overheat (this can occur due to incorrect carburetor settings and an overly lean mixture). After starting the engine, always wait about 3-4 minutes for it to warm up properly before setting off. Avoid sudden jerks and maximum loads on the engine and clutch assembly during the break-in period. Accelerate smoothly and try to avoid prolonged riding at low engine speeds. Shift gears smoothly, ensuring the clutch is fully engaged and the throttle is released. Initially, the gearbox operation may seem imprecise, but this is no cause for alarm. With each ride, the components will settle into each other, and gear shifts will become smoother and more reliable.

#### Oil Change During Break-In

After the first 2 hours of engine operation, [drain the transportation oil](http://mypitbike.ru/blog/workshop/4.html) and fill it with oil from a reputable manufacturer of the recommended type and viscosity. After approximately 18 engine hours, perform a second oil change, again completely draining the old oil and refilling with new. The next oil change should occur at the 35 engine hour mark. After this, the break-in can be considered complete, and you can fully enjoy the power of your pit bike!

#### Throttle Operation During Break-In

Most manufacturers recommend the following throttle application table during the first 1000 km. Avoid fully opening the throttle!

1. 0 – 150 km. Try to keep the throttle within ¼ (25%), vary the speed, and be sure to change gears. Turn off the engine after each hour and let it cool for 10 minutes.
2. 150 – 500 km. Do not open the throttle more than ½ (50%) of its range.
3. 500 – 1000 km. Do not open the throttle more than ¾ (75%) of its range.
