# About

Hello, my name is Roman Biriukov (many know me as Pr1me), and this is my pet project, which I maintain in my spare time from my main job. In 2012, I created the blog-social network MyPitbike, where I shared my experiences in owning and maintaining pit bikes. I endeavored to meticulously document every manipulation I performed on my motorcycles, from assembly, seasonal maintenance, to subsequent modifications. My goal was to create a unique knowledge base for the Russian-speaking community, promoting this class of motorcycles.

Over time, a team of like-minded enthusiasts joined me, and together we crafted guides and manuals that have stood the test of time. We were among the first to ride pit bikes in Russia when this class of mini motorcycles was still unfamiliar. People sought our help in choosing and purchasing their first motorcycles, advice on selecting parts, and precise tuning of mechanisms and components.

By analyzing traffic statistics and page popularity, I noticed an increasing number of requests coming from outside the Ru segment of the internet, with many visitors using translation tools to acquire the necessary information. This insight spurred the idea of creating an international English version and restructuring the knowledge base for easier search and navigation. Particular attention was given to search functionality and the potential integration of AI, including a RAG pipeline.

Some information and illustrations were sourced from the internet and scanned from magazines. Due to the low quality of some original images, which were created long ago when technology was outdated and internet speed was slower, it was necessary to apply neural network upscaling to achieve an image that is sufficiently high-quality and sharp by today's standards.

Additionally, I would like to mention that I am not a professional mechanic, and English is not my native language, so you may encounter inaccuracies in the guides. If you have any comments or suggestions, please send feedback, and I will try to incorporate them. If you ever need to contact me directly, please mail to "hello at mypitbike.ru".

Thank you, and I hope this project helps you solve your problem. If you found this resource helpful, you can support it by [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mypitbike).
