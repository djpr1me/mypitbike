Welcome to the MyPitbike Knowledge Base repository—a one-stop resource for pit bike enthusiasts. This project offers comprehensive repair and maintenance guides, technical handbooks, and library manuals, all packaged in a user-friendly format with AI-powered search. The aim is to make detailed technical knowledge accessible to everyone. Beyond that, this project serves as my hands-on platform to modernize legacy systems and build a comprehensive development workflow, including a CI/CD pipeline and LLM integrations for future RAG-based chatbot functionality.
