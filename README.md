# MyPitbike Knowledge Base

Welcome to the MyPitbike knowledge base repository!

This personal pet project marks the next iteration of the blog-social network MyPitbike.ru, created in 2012. Over the years, it has gained significant popularity within the Russian-speaking community as a go-to source for information on repairing and maintaining their mini motocross bikes.
My mission is to compile all available knowledge and present it in a user-friendly knowledge base format with AI-powered search. This ensures that even those less familiar with IT can quickly find precise answers to their specific questions.

Personally, my goal is to improve my skills in using frameworks, progressing from setting up a development environment and launching a local project to establishing a CI/CD pipeline for deploying to a live server, while also creating a comprehensive knowledge base to train an LLM and function as a Q&A Telegram chat bot.
