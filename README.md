# MyPitbike Knowledge Base

Welcome to the MyPitbike knowledge base repository!

This personal pet project marks the next iteration of the blog-social network MyPitbike.ru, created in 2012. Over the years, it has gained significant popularity within the Russian-speaking community as a go-to source for information on repairing and maintaining their mini motocross bikes.
My mission is to compile all available knowledge and present it in a user-friendly knowledge base format with AI-powered search. This ensures that even those less familiar with IT can quickly find precise answers to their specific questions.
